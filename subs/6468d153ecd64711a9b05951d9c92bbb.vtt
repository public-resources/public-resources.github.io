Okay, I was wrong.

(ALL LAUGH)
(GROWLS)

183
00:08:52.331 --> 00:08:53.830
Not again.

184
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.880
Hey, Kion,
meet our new friend.

185
00:08:58.881 --> 00:08:59.960
Yun Mibu.

186
00:08:59.961 --> 00:09:01.880
We don't have time
for new friends.

187
00:09:01.881 --> 00:09:04.500
Um, they were just
saying hello.

188
00:09:04.501 --> 00:09:06.170
I wasn't talking to you.

189
00:09:06.171 --> 00:09:07.290

(GRUNTS)

192
00:09:10.171 --> 00:09:12.330
Kion, why did you
scare him like that?

193
00:09:12.331 --> 00:09:16.170
Beshte, we can't stop
every time you see
a new animal.

194
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:18.000
I was just being nice.

195
00:09:18.001 --> 00:09:20.960
That's the problem.
You're slowing us down.

196
00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:22.670
Stop being nice.

197
00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:25.790
"Stop being nice"? I...

198
00:09:25.791 --> 00:09:27.500
I don't know how
to do that?

199
00:09:27.501 --> 00:09:29.670
Kion, have some Tuliza.

200
00:09:29.671 --> 00:09:31.330
It'll help you
feel better.

201
00:09:31.331 --> 00:09:32.670
Forget it, Makini.
(GASPS)

202
00:09:32.671 --> 00:09:34.670
The Tuliza's
not working anymore.

203
00:09:34.671 --> 00:09:36.290
Evil!

204
00:09:36.291 --> 00:09:38.460
Kion, you're
out of control.

205
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:41.670
Am I? All I want to do
is get to the Tree of Life

206
00:09:41.671 --> 00:09:43.000
so I can get better,

207
00:09:43.001 --> 00:09:45.000
but everyone keeps
slowing me down.

208
00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:46.750
We're not trying
to slow you down.

209
00:09:46.751 --> 00:09:48.290
We're trying
to help you get there.

(SIGHS) Feels like
I'm dragging you along.

211
00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:54.500
Kion, your scar hurts,

212
00:09:54.501 --> 00:09:56.210
so you're not
thinking straight.

213
00:09:56.211 --> 00:09:57.670
That's why you were
mean to Beshte.

214
00:09:57.671 --> 00:09:58.830
I'm not being mean.

215
00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.420
You kinda are.

216
00:10:01.421 --> 00:10:03.080
(GROWLS)
Kion.

217
00:10:03.081 --> 00:10:06.000
Maybe this is
one of those times
when I should take over.

218
00:10:06.001 --> 00:10:07.960
Take over?
Until you feel better.

219
00:10:07.961 --> 00:10:09.960
I'm the leader
of the Guard, Fuli,

220
00:10:09.961 --> 00:10:11.790
and I don't think so.

221
00:10:11.791 --> 00:10:14.580
(GROWLS)
Don't do this, Kion.

222
00:10:14.581 --> 00:10:15.920
Are... (GASPS)

223
00:10:15.921 --> 00:10:17.750
Are they going to fight?

224
00:10:17.751 --> 00:10:18.830
Looks like it.

225
00:10:18.831 --> 00:10:20.500
I'm glad I can't watch.

226
00:10:20.501 --> 00:10:22.880
But Kion wouldn't
fight Fuli. Would he?

227
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:24.580
Of course, he would.

228
00:10:24.581 --> 00:10:27.170
This is what
I've been talking about.

229
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
It's all happening right now
just like Rafiki said.

230
00:10:32.001 --> 00:10:33.540
What's "Just like
Rafiki said"?

231
00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.420
He said if the venom
stays inside you too long,

232
00:10:36.421 --> 00:10:38.540
you won't know the difference
between right and wrong.

233
00:10:38.541 --> 00:10:39.620
Yeah, but...

234
00:10:39.621 --> 00:10:42.670
And it's happened.
You've been acting mean
all day.

235
00:10:42.671 --> 00:10:44.710
I... I have?

236
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.210
You did tell us not
to stop and help.

237
00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.420
You knocked over
that peacock.

238
00:10:51.421 --> 00:10:53.040
And scared
that clouded leopard.

239
00:10:53.041 --> 00:10:55.670
And worst of all,
you yelled at Beshte.

240
00:10:55.671 --> 00:10:57.830
Sorry, buddy,
you're turning evil.

241
00:10:57.831 --> 00:10:59.960
You really think
I'm evil?

242
00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.420
Totally!
But don't feel bad.

243
00:11:02.421 --> 00:11:05.120
You can't help it.
It's your scar.

244
00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.830
Guys, you all think
I'm turning evil?

245
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.500
Well...

246
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
I... I don't know
if I'd say evil...

247
00:11:14.001 --> 00:11:15.040
No.

248
00:11:15.041 --> 00:11:17.040
Uh, yeah.

249
00:11:17.041 --> 00:11:19.500
Don't listen to Bunga.
Nobody thinks you're evil,

250
00:11:19.501 --> 00:11:21.000
and once we get
to the Tree of Life...

251
00:11:21.001 --> 00:11:22.620
Unless it's too late.

252
00:11:22.621 --> 00:11:24.540
Good Kion might
be gone forever.

253
00:11:24.541 --> 00:11:27.330
I'm not evil!

255
00:11:29.921 --> 00:11:33.000

(GRUMBLES)

257
00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:38.380
Kion, come back.

258
00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.000
Don't worry, Beshte,
he'll be back.

259
00:11:43.001 --> 00:11:45.330
He just needs
time to himself.

260
00:11:45.331 --> 00:11:48.540
But which Kion will he be
when he comes back?

261
00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:50.170
Good Kion?

262
00:11:50.171 --> 00:11:53.000
Or evil Kion?

263
00:11:53.001 --> 00:11:55.540
Bunga.
What? We all saw
it happening.

264
00:11:55.541 --> 00:11:56.830
Somebody had to say it.

265
00:11:56.831 --> 00:11:59.000
No. Nobody had
to say it.

266
00:11:59.001 --> 00:12:00.710
Kion's not evil.

267
00:12:00.711 --> 00:12:01.880
You sure?

268
00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:05.000
I am. Kion will never
turn evil.

00:15:36.501 --> 00:15:39.710
I may look like you,
but I'll never act like you.

355
00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:45.580
Except, I guess,

356
00:15:45.581 --> 00:15:47.710
I kinda have been acting
mean today.

357
00:15:47.711 --> 00:15:49.920
(SIGHS)
I got to go apologize.

358
00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:51.460
Whoa!

359
00:15:51.461 --> 00:15:52.580
(EXCLAIMS)

360
00:15:52.581 --> 00:15:54.330
(GRUNTS)

361
00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:01.000
Great.

362
00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:11.330
I'm getting worried
about Kion.

363
00:16:11.331 --> 00:16:15.290
Me, too. I hope he
didn't get lost or hurt.

364
00:16:15.291 --> 00:16:17.250
Maybe we should
look for him.

365
00:16:17.251 --> 00:16:18.830
Not that I would
be much help.

366
00:16:18.831 --> 00:16:20.420
He has been gone
for a while.

367
00:16:20.421 --> 00:16:22.380
Anga, see if you
can spot him.

368
00:16:22.381 --> 00:16:24.080
Yep. Anga Lin...

369
00:16:24.081 --> 00:16:26.920
Hey, hey, hey,
look for signs of evil roars.

370
00:16:26.921 --> 00:16:28.420
Trees knocked down,
terrified animals,

371
00:16:28.421 --> 00:16:30.290
exploding volcanoes,
that kind of thing.

372
00:16:30.291 --> 00:16:32.380
Bunga, if Kion roared,

373
00:16:32.381 --> 00:16:34.040
I think we would
have heard it.

374
00:16:34.041 --> 00:16:35.710
Good point.
Yep.

375
00:16:35.711 --> 00:16:36.960
Anga Linga.
(EXCLAIMS)

376
00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:49.920
ANGA: Nothing. Nothing.

377
00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:53.500
What?

378
00:16:53.501 --> 00:16:55.000
(GASPS) Kion.

379
00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:57.580
Kion.

380
00:16:57.581 --> 00:16:59.380
Anga. (EXCLAIMS)

381
00:16:59.381 --> 00:17:01.250
Am I glad to see you.

382
00:17:01.251 --> 00:17:04.330
Like some help?
Yeah, that'd be great.

383
00:17:04.331 --> 00:17:06.540
Okay. (GRUNTS)

384
00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:11.210
Can't get close enough.

385
00:17:11.211 --> 00:17:12.670
Maybe I can reach you.

386
00:17:12.671 --> 00:17:15.420
(BOTH GRUNT)

387
00:17:15.421 --> 00:17:17.000
(EXCLAIMS)

388
00:17:17.001 --> 00:17:19.750
No use. Hang on.
I'll be back.

389
00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:22.880
Thanks, Anga.

390
00:17:22.881 --> 00:17:25.040
Just, uh,
don't be too long.

391
00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:27.880
ANGA: Found him.
Great.

392
00:17:27.881 --> 00:17:29.540
Not really. Come on.

393
00:17:29.541 --> 00:17:31.080
Let's go.

394
00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.210
Kion's down there,

395
00:17:33.211 --> 00:17:34.620
hanging from a branch.

396
00:17:34.621 --> 00:17:36.580
Anga, is that you?
Yep.

397
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.920
We are all here.
Hi, Kion.

398
00:17:38.921 --> 00:17:40.580
Don't worry.
We'll help you.

399
00:17:40.581 --> 00:17:42.380
Just hang in there.

400
00:17:42.381 --> 00:17:44.670
But, Fuli, what if this
is an evil trap?

401
00:17:44.671 --> 00:17:46.210
Ah, Bunga.

402
00:17:46.211 --> 00:17:48.040
Just sayin'.
KION: Thanks, guys.

403
00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:52.250
Listen, about what
happened back there,
I really didn't mean to...

404
00:17:52.251 --> 00:17:54.460
Kion, don't think
about that now.

405
00:17:54.461 --> 00:17:56.170
Let's just get you
off that branch.

406
00:17:56.171 --> 00:17:58.330
Sounds good. Thanks.

407
00:17:58.331 --> 00:18:01.170
He's too close
to the overhang.
I can't reach him.

408
00:18:01.171 --> 00:18:03.830
I could get close enough,
but I can't carry him.

409
00:18:03.831 --> 00:18:06.170
Ooh, maybe I can
reach him.

410
00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:14.790
Just out
of reach. (GRUNTS)

411
00:18:14.791 --> 00:18:15.920
Sorry, Kion.

412
00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:18.830
Hey, Bunga, it's okay.

413
00:18:18.831 --> 00:18:20.960
And you know what
I said before

414
00:18:20.961 --> 00:18:23.120
about you turning
evil and stuff...
Yeah.

415
00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:25.710
Are you?

416
00:18:25.711 --> 00:18:27.580
I don't think so.

417
00:18:27.581 --> 00:18:29.540
Even I was kinda
acting like it.

418
00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:31.330
Just checking,

419
00:18:31.331 --> 00:18:34.170
and just so you know,
even if you do turn evil,

420
00:18:34.171 --> 00:18:35.580
I'll still be
your best friend.

421
00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.000
(GRUNTS) Thanks, Bunga.

422
00:18:39.001 --> 00:18:41.500
Okay, Fuli,
what's the plan?

423
00:18:41.501 --> 00:18:43.290
Someone's gotta
climb down

424
00:18:43.291 --> 00:18:44.750
and help pull him
back up.

425
00:18:44.751 --> 00:18:46.380
Oh, maybe I can.

426
00:18:46.381 --> 00:18:48.210
You're definitely
strong enough, Beshte,

427
00:18:48.211 --> 00:18:50.460
but you're not much
of a climber.

428
00:18:50.461 --> 00:18:53.170
I wasn't thinking me, Fuli.
I had someone else in mind.

429
00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:00.880
YUN MIBU: Uh, I can climb
down there.

430
00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.580
(GROANS) But you
didn't tell me
it was the scary guy

431
00:19:04.581 --> 00:19:06.040
who needed
to be rescued.

432
00:19:06.041 --> 00:19:09.380
Don't worry, Yun Mibu,
Kion's really a nice guy.

433
00:19:09.381 --> 00:19:12.040
He was just feeling
kinda evil today,

434
00:19:12.041 --> 00:19:13.710
but he's over that now.

435
00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.500
Please help him. Please.

436
00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:22.880
Mmm, Kion, is it?

437
00:19:22.881 --> 00:19:24.460
Yeah, that's me,

438
00:19:24.461 --> 00:19:27.620
and I think I owe you
an apology.

439
00:19:27.621 --> 00:19:30.540
Uh, how about
a promise, instead?

440
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:34.120
A promise?
Yes.

441
00:19:34.121 --> 00:19:35.750
No more growling.

442
00:19:35.751 --> 00:19:38.330
No more growling.
I promise.

443
00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:40.540
Then let's get you
up from there.

444
00:19:40.541 --> 00:19:42.830
Are you sure
you can do this?

445
00:19:42.831 --> 00:19:44.000
Oh, yeah.

446
00:19:44.001 --> 00:19:47.040
Clouded leopards are about
the best climbers
there are, Kion.

447
00:19:47.041 --> 00:19:48.170
Common knowledge, really.

448
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:52.960
Wow, I see what
you mean, Ono.

449
00:19:52.961 --> 00:19:56.080
(GRUNTS) Reach out.
I've got you.

450
00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:59.250
Okay. Here it goes.

453
00:20:03.921 --> 00:20:05.000
BOTH: Jump!

(GRUNTS)

455
00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:08.790
Got you.

456
00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.710
(EXCLAIMS) I think...

457
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:14.960
Anga Linga!

458
00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:20.460
(PANTS)

459
00:20:20.461 --> 00:20:22.170
Phew. Thank you.

460
00:20:22.171 --> 00:20:23.500
Nice save, Anga.

461
00:20:23.501 --> 00:20:25.880
Way to go, Yun Mibu.
I knew you could do it.

462
00:20:25.881 --> 00:20:28.420
You gotta teach me
how to use
my tail like that.

463
00:20:28.421 --> 00:20:30.540
Ah, you're gonna need
a bigger tail.

464
00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.290
Thanks, again.

465
00:20:32.291 --> 00:20:34.210
Is there anything
I can do for you in return?

466
00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:38.120
Just remember to never growl
at a clouded leopard.

467
00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.170
We don't like it.

468
00:20:40.171 --> 00:20:41.170
I'll remember.

469
00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:43.460
Bye, everybody.
See you, Beshte.

470
00:20:43.461 --> 00:20:44.920
BESHTE: Bye, Yun Mibu.

471
00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:48.330
Everyone, I don't know
what to say.

472
00:20:48.331 --> 00:20:52.170
Other than, I'm really sorry
about the way I was acting.

473
00:20:52.171 --> 00:20:54.040
Especially, you, Beshte.

474
00:20:54.041 --> 00:20:55.420
I was really
mean to you.

475
00:20:55.421 --> 00:20:57.080
It's all right, Kion.

476
00:20:57.081 --> 00:20:59.380
It wasn't you talking.
It was your scar.

477
00:20:59.381 --> 00:21:01.290
Which reminds me...

478
00:21:01.291 --> 00:21:03.710
Maybe the Tuliza's
not working
like it used to,

479
00:21:03.711 --> 00:21:05.250
but it can't hurt.

480
00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:11.000
You're right.
(GRUNTING)

481
00:21:11.001 --> 00:21:13.380
(GULPS) Thanks, Makini.

482
00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:16.330
I know we lost
a lot of time today

483
00:21:16.331 --> 00:21:18.380
and it was totally
my fault,

484
00:21:18.381 --> 00:21:20.210
but if we leave now,
we can make up for...

485
00:21:20.211 --> 00:21:23.170
Hold it, Kion.
I'm still in charge,
remember?

486
00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:27.170
And you need to rest.

487
00:21:27.171 --> 00:21:28.830
You've been through
a lot today.

488
00:21:28.831 --> 00:21:30.790
Better listen
to the cheetah in charge.

489
00:21:30.791 --> 00:21:32.250
Tree of Life's not going
anywhere, Kion.

490
00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.960
Soon, Kion.
We'll move on soon.

491
00:21:35.961 --> 00:21:37.710
But we're so close.
