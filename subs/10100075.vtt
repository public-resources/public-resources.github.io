That rock slide
must'a really
spooked 'em!

ONO: There's a dead end
canyon up ahead to the left!

8
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.169
If we guide
the herd there,

9
00:01:22.169 --> 00:01:24.119
we can contain them
and calm them down!

10
00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.829
Great idea, Ono!

11
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.420
Let's follow Ono's plan!

I don't know.

19
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.830
But I'm going to find out.

20
00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:59.879
KION: So is everyone
calmed down?

21
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:01.960
Great!

22
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.250
Then you're good to go home.

23
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.080
Slowly this time, okay?

24
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.620

26
00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:12.709
Oh, hi, Makuu.

27
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.540
Makuu?

28
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.920
Makuu?

29
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.380
I thought you'd be sleeping
through the dry season

30
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.420
with the rest
of the crocodiles.

31
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.619
Oh, I was.

32
00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:24.329
But then someone
drove a herd of antelope

33
00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:26.999
right past our sleeping cave!

34
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.250
Hey! I think he might be
talking about us!

35
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.380
He is.

36
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.250
And using this canyon
was my idea!

37
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.250
Whoa!
So it's all your fault!

38
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.329
Bunga!
No, Bunga's right.

39
00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:37.669
It is my fault!

40
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.710
I'm so sorry, Makuu.

41
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.420
I forgot your float
was sleeping in that cave.

42
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.920
We were sleeping.

43
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.880
But now,
thanks to the Lion Guard,

44
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.789
we're all wide awake!

45
00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:50.039
So whaddaya
gonna do about it, huh?

46
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.080
Take it easy, Kiburi.

47
00:02:52.121 --> 00:02:55.461
Sheesh! Somebody got up
on the wrong side
of the cave.

48
00:02:55.461 --> 00:02:57.750
You can't blame him
for bein' upset.

49
00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.289
We did wake 'em up.

50
00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.210
And crocodiles usually
spend the whole dry season
in deep sleep.

51
00:03:02.211 --> 00:03:05.081
But once they're awake,
they can't go back
to their deep sleep!

52
00:03:05.081 --> 00:03:07.170
No way!
That's not true!

53
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.330
MAKUU: But it is.

54
00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.290
We crocodiles need a whole
lot of water to survive.

55
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.040
Since there isn't enough
to go around
in the dry season,

56
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.500
we sleep through it.

57
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.620
Whoa!

58
00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.380
Ono, you really messed up...

59
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.670
ALL: Bunga!

60
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.829
If Ono's the reason
we're awake,

61
00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:27.459
I say we deal with him
the crocodile way!

Kiburi!
Control yourself!

65
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.249
I'll handle this.

66
00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:36.379
Yes, Makuu.

67
00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:38.209
Now that we're awake,

68
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.380
we'll need water
for the rest
of the dry season.

69
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.250
Any idea
where we'll find it?

70
00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:46.669
We'll go to my dad.

71
00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:48.079
Your dad?

72
00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:49.209

73
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.420
Kiburi...

74
00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.250
Yeah. My dad.

75
00:03:52.291 --> 00:03:55.541
He makes sure everyone
has enough water
in the dry season.

76
00:03:55.541 --> 00:03:56.920
Everyone?

77
00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.499
I know he'll take care
of you and your float, Makuu.

78
00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:00.959
He'd better.

79
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.080
I'm going to speak
to King Simba.

80
00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.170
Stay here
until I come back.

81
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.540
Stay here?

82
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.880
But...
(ROARS)

83
00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.960
Yeah, okay, Makuu.

84
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.419
Whatever you say.

85
00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:12.419
You're the leader.

86
00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.379
And don't you forget it.

87
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:19.750
Don't worry, Ono.

88
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.290
Everything's gonna be okay.

89
00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:23.669
I hope.

90
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.830
Crocodiles awake
in the dry season?

91
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.250
Something's up.

92
00:04:33.079 --> 00:04:34.789
Okay, they're gone.

93
00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:37.079
Now, this is how
it's going down.

94
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.120
We're leaving
this dried-out canyon

95
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.500
and finding us some water!

96
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.830
But you just said...
Never mind what I said!

97
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.380
Listen to what I'm saying!

98
00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.879
We're crocodiles!

99
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.250
We don't wait around
for other animals
to tell us what to do!

100
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.920
We take what we want!

101
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.790
Yeah! He's right!

102
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.580
Yeah, we do!

103
00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.580
So I say
we don't stay here!

104
00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.250
I say we spread out
and get ourselves
some water!

105
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.500
Are you with me?

106
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.710
ALL: Yeah!

107
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:04.880
Then let's go!

108
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.540
Hmm-mmm.

109
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.420
Crocs on the rampage.

110
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.169
Ushari will want to
hear about this.

111
00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:13.959
And so will Scar!

112
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.500
Your spies
have done well, Ushari.

113
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.289
This is very
good news indeed.

114
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.960
Crocodiles detest
the dry season.

115
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.460
And they won't easily
forgive Simba's son

116
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.380
and his Lion Guard
for waking them.

117
00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.119
It could give us
an opportunity.

118
00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:37.209
Yes.

119
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.420
That's what I thought, too.

120
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.750
Have your Skinks
keep an eye
on the situation.

121
00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.670
Tell me immediately
if anything changes.

122
00:05:45.619 --> 00:05:46.709
You heard that?

123
00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:48.249
Yes, sir.

124
00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:52.370
The Lion Guard's
mistake could prove
most fortuitous for us.

125
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.380
Perhaps it will even lead
to the end of Simba's reign.

126
00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.330
And then we reptiles
will rule the Pride Lands!

127
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.170
Uh, under your
leadership, of course.

128
00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:05.540
Right, Scar?

129
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.420
Of course, Ushari.

130
00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.580
Of course.

131
00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:12.169
(LAUGHS MANIACALLY)

MAKUU: It really is
a matter of our survival,
Your Majesty.

133
00:06:20.501 --> 00:06:22.120
They sure have been
talking awhile.

134
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.579
You think they're
talking about me?

135
00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.830
I'm pretty sure
they're more worried
about where the crocs

136
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.830
are gonna live
for the rest
of the dry season.

137
00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.540
Yeah. But it's my fault
the crocs are awake!

138
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.540
(WHIMPERS) What if I'm
exiled to the Outlands?

139
00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.709
Or fed to the crocs!

140
00:06:36.709 --> 00:06:37.669
Easy, Ono.

141
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.580
None of that's gonna happen!

142
00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:40.710
You just made a mistake.

143
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.170
Yeah, you heard Kion.

144
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.540
You got nothin'
to worry about!

145
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.380
Ono!
Come over here.

146
00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.499
But, I could be wrong.

147
00:06:47.499 --> 00:06:48.499
Oh, no...

148
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.330
Perhaps,
you don't understand

149
00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.500
how much water
crocodiles need, sire.

150
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.830
I do, Makuu.

151
00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.380
And I'll see
that you have it.

152
00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.709
Dad? What if Ono looks out
over the Pride Lands

153
00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.670
to see which watering hole
is least crowded?

154
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.210
Then maybe that one
can go to the crocodiles!

155
00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:09.540
Excellent idea, Kion.

156
00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.419
Ono?
Yes, Your Majesty!

157
00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:12.419
It'd be my pleasure!

158
00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.920
I'm sure we can
find a place
for your float, Makuu.

159
00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.920
Thank you,
Your Majesty.

160
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.000
I want to
settle this peacefully.

162
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.750
Kion! Your Majesty!
The crocodiles
are everywhere!

163
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:38.660
They've moved
in to watering holes
all over the Pride Lands!

164

Crocodiles?

165
00:07:40.461 --> 00:07:43.711
Makuu? I thought
you said you wanted to
settle this peacefully.

166
00:07:43.711 --> 00:07:45.380
I do! I do!

167
00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.669
Whoever is doing this,

168
00:07:46.669 --> 00:07:48.579
they're defying
a direct order!

finish this later.

I need to deal
with my float.

171
00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:53.710
Makuu, wait.

172
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:55.500
We are very close
to a solution.

173
00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.620
Let the Lion Guard
handle this.

174
00:07:58.379 --> 00:08:00.959
Mmm. Very well.

175
00:08:00.959 --> 00:08:03.079
We need to split up
to gather them all.

This is our
watering hole now!

182
00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.330
We say
when you can drink!

183
00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:20.620
And if you don't listen...

184
00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.380
Lemme show you
what'll happen.

185
00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.459
KION: Stop
right there, Kiburi!

186
00:08:24.459 --> 00:08:26.209
This is not your place!

187
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:28.500
Leave the impalas alone!

188
00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.830
It's our place now Kion.

189
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:32.880
And I'm gonna
teach 'em who's boss!

190
00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:37.499
(GRUNTS)

191
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.120
Okay, fine.

192
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.710
I'll teach you instead.

193
00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:42.710
MAKUU: Kiburi!

194
00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:44.710
What are you doing?

195
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:46.920
What you should have
told us to do!

196
00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.709
I'm takin'
the water we need!

197
00:08:48.709 --> 00:08:50.459
Against my orders!

198
00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:53.830
You knew I was talking
to King Simba to get help.

199
00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:56.710
Yes. And together
we have found
a watering hole

200
00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:58.620
that you can
have for your own.

201
00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.169
KIBURI: Hmph!
SIMBA: Kion, will you
and the Lion Guard

202
00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:05.160
escort Makuu
and the crocodiles
to their dry season home?

203
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.210
KION: Sure, Dad.

204
00:09:10.879 --> 00:09:12.079
See, Ono?

205
00:09:12.079 --> 00:09:14.619
Now the crocs have
their own watering hole.

206
00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.290
Everything's
gonna be fine.

207
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:18.000
Just like Kion said.

208
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.880
Maybe my mistake wasn't
such a disaster after all.

209
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.620
This is a disaster!

210
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:23.829
Oh...

211
00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:25.709
I know
it's crowded, Kiburi.

212
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:27.790
But it really
is a good spot.

213
00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:29.710
My dad says
there's enough
water and fish

214
00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:31.830
to last you
the whole dry season.

215
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:33.210
Oh, really?

216
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:34.750
"Your dad" says so?

217
00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:37.829
Hey!
"His dad" is your King.

218
00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:40.790
Yeah. And besides,
there's tons of water!

219
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:42.250
I'll show ya!

220
00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:44.290
<i>Zuka zama!</i>

221
00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:45.540
(BUNGA GROANS)

222
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.880
Ha! That's some hard water.

223
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.039
At least you get to be
close to all your friends.

224
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.620
Yeah.
Really close!

225
00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:54.670
See? I didn't even
get my feet wet!

226
00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:57.620
The honey badger
can't even get
his feet wet!

227
00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:59.619
What kind of
watering hole is this?

228
00:09:59.619 --> 00:10:00.919
I know it's not perfect.

229
00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.960
But it's the best way
to get our float
through the dry season.

230
00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.710
It's a compromise.

231
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:08.170
Compromise?

232
00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.880
Since when is that
the crocodile way?

233
00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:15.169
Kiburi,
the dry season is dry.

234
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:19.290
There's not much
water anywhere
in the Pride Lands.

235
00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:20.790
This is our share.

236
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:21.960
Share?

237
00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.789
We're crocodiles, Makuu!

238
00:10:23.789 --> 00:10:25.379
We deserve better!

239
00:10:25.379 --> 00:10:27.749
This is the best
we can get.

240
00:10:27.791 --> 00:10:32.371
If you don't like it,
you can try your luck
in the Outlands!

241
00:10:32.371 --> 00:10:35.670
Or I can call
for a <i>Mashindano!</i>

242
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:36.789
(ALL GASP)

243
00:10:36.789 --> 00:10:38.789
A <i>Mashindano?</i>

244
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:40.880
So now you
want to fight me

245
00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.830
for leadership
of the crocodiles, huh?

246
00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:45.830
It's the crocodile way.

247
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:47.079
Then I accept.

248
00:10:47.079 --> 00:10:49.999
Lake Matope at sunset.

249
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.830
I know the tradition,
Makuu.

250
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:54.000
Let's see if you
still know how to fight.

251
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:03.830
(SCAR LAUGHS MANIACALLY)

252
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:08.040
A <i>Mashindano?</i>

253
00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.500
At sunset. Tonight.

254
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.249
You have brought me
valuable information.

255
00:11:13.249 --> 00:11:16.539
Well done, Skinks.

256
00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:18.120
Tell me, Ushari.

257
00:11:18.161 --> 00:11:22.461
Does the <i>Mashindano
</i> still attract large crowds
of Pride Landers?

258
00:11:22.461 --> 00:11:25.169
Yes.
Yes, it does.

259
00:11:25.169 --> 00:11:28.329
Some things never change.

260
00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:32.620
And even the royal family
attends the <i>Mashindano.</i>

261
00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.460
Correct?
Yes!

262
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:40.619
So, it's the perfect time
to get rid of King Simba.

263
00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:42.710
How are we
going to do that?

264
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:44.210
We needn't do much at all.

265
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:48.670
Kiburi and his crocs
will do the dirty work
for us.

266
00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:50.499
You'd be surprised
what can be done

267
00:11:50.541 --> 00:11:54.501
while everyone else
is distracted
by the Mashindano.

268
00:11:54.501 --> 00:11:56.920
Ushari. I need you
to trick Kiburi

269
00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.790
into thinking he can
rule the Pride Lands.

270
00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:01.919
He'll rule the Pride Lands?

271
00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.670
Of course not!

272
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:06.750
But we want him
to believe that he will,

273
00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:09.790
so he'll do what we want.

274
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.670
Yes! Of course!

275
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:13.999
Now...

276
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.790
Here's the plan
I want you to plant

277
00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:18.790
in Kiburi's tiny little brain.

278
00:12:25.919 --> 00:12:27.879
You think Kiburi can win?

279
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.170
I hope not.

280
00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:32.250
Yeah. Makuu's
become a good leader.

281
00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:36.000
And you've discussed
the plan with your crocs?

282
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.289
Yeah, yeah.

283
00:12:37.289 --> 00:12:38.879
They know what to do.

284
00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.960
You're a smart snake,
Ushari.

285
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.920
I like how you think.

286
00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.420
Thanks.

287
00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:47.080
I just want to be
on the winning side.

288
00:12:48.039 --> 00:12:49.329
And you will be!

289
00:12:49.329 --> 00:12:50.419
TAMKA: Kiburi!

290
00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:52.000
Time for the <i>Mashindano!</i>

291
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.170
Great.

292
00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:55.750
You three know what to do
while I'm fighting, right?

293
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:56.960
Oh, yeah!

294
00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.750
He'll never see us coming.

295
00:12:58.750 --> 00:12:59.879
Good.

296
00:12:59.879 --> 00:13:01.789
Once I defeat Makuu,

297
00:13:01.789 --> 00:13:03.959
not only
will I rule the float,

298
00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:07.120
but we crocs will rule
the whole Pride Lands!

It's starting!

303
00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.500
All right, Kiburi.

304
00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.790
You wanted this <i>Mashindano.</i>

305
00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:26.079
Let's see what you got.

306
00:13:26.079 --> 00:13:27.999

(BOTH GRUNTING)

309
00:13:34.539 --> 00:13:37.329
Okay. Split up
and meet at the target.

310
00:13:37.329 --> 00:13:38.919
Then we'll take him down!

(GRUNTING)

312
00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.380
You think that's enough
to beat me, Kiburi?

ALL: Ooh!

314
00:13:48.919 --> 00:13:50.999
Ugh! Crocodile violence!

315
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.670
I don't want to watch this.

316
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.290
Huh. That's strange.

317
00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:58.790
A crocodile leaving
the <i>Mashindano?</i>

318
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:59.829
Wait a tic...

319
00:14:01.669 --> 00:14:03.499
ONO: What are you guys
up to?

320
00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.120
(PANTING)

321
00:14:06.161 --> 00:14:08.921
I just saw three crocodiles
leaving the <i>Mashindano.</i>

322
00:14:08.921 --> 00:14:10.960
Three crocodiles?
Yes.

323
00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.919
And nothing's
more important
to the crocodiles

324
00:14:12.919 --> 00:14:14.079
than the <i>Mashindano.</i>

325
00:14:14.079 --> 00:14:15.619
It doesn't make sense.

326
00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:17.380
It doesn't make sense.

327
00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:18.620
Keep an eye on 'em.

328
00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:19.790
Affirmative.

329
00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.120
Fuli, Beshte, Bunga.

330
00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.539
What's the kerbubble, Kion?

331
00:14:24.539 --> 00:14:26.039
Something's up
with the crocs,

332
00:14:26.039 --> 00:14:27.959
but I'm not sure what.

333
00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.460
We'll need to be careful.

334
00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.170
There's a lot of
animals here.

335
00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:33.790
We don't want to scare them
and start a stampede.

336
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:34.790
Come on!

337
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:39.710

I've figured it out!

339

The crocs!
They're sneaking up
on your dad!

340
00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.120
My dad?

341
00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.620
Yes. And I think
they're going to attack him!

343
00:14:50.329 --> 00:14:51.669
Of course.

344
00:14:51.711 --> 00:14:54.211
They're using the <i>Mashindano
</i> as a distraction!

345
00:14:54.211 --> 00:14:55.330
Go around the crowd!

346
00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.080
They're moving to
ambush him from behind.

347
00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.080
Let's go!

348
00:15:00.039 --> 00:15:02.959
(CHUCKLES)
It's just like Kiburi said.

349
00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.960
Now, let's do this.

351
00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.960
If you're smart,
you'll stop right now.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.329
Well, we're not smart!

353
00:15:13.329 --> 00:15:14.709
So get out of our way.

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:31.620
What is going on?

359
00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:34.120
Nothing now, Dad.

360
00:15:36.169 --> 00:15:38.119
They were trying
to ambush me.

361
00:15:38.119 --> 00:15:40.789
And use the <i>Mashindano
</i> for cover.

362
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:42.420
But Ono saw it coming.

363
00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.000
Hmmm.
I know these crocodiles.

364
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.080
They wouldn't have come up
with this themselves.

365
00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.499
(KIBURI GRUNTING)

366
00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.960
What's the matter, Kiburi?

367
00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.080
Can't move?

368
00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.380
(GRUNTING)

369
00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:58.790
Simba's gone.

370
00:15:59.829 --> 00:16:01.789
Fine.

371
00:16:01.789 --> 00:16:04.959
CROCODILES:
Makuu! Makuu! Makuu!

372
00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:08.170
Ha! This <i>Mashindano
</i> means nothing.

373
00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:10.000
While you were all
watching us fight,

374
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.960
my loyal crocodiles
took down King Simba!

375
00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.119
Yeah. Yeah, you heard me!

376
00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.120
And with the Lion King gone,

377
00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.790
all of yous
answer to us crocodiles!

378
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:20.960
SIMBA: Really?

379
00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.420
Is that how it works?

380
00:16:24.459 --> 00:16:25.789
What?

381
00:16:25.789 --> 00:16:27.169
But how...

382
00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:28.330
The Lion Guard!

383
00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:29.670
That's how!

384
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:31.170
Your Majesty.

385
00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:34.580
I assure you,
I had no knowledge
of this scheme.

386
00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:37.170
I know.
This came from Kiburi.

387
00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:39.579
But since you are
the crocodile leader,

388
00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:42.540
I'll defer
his punishment to you.

389
00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.920
Kiburi lost the <i>Mashindano.</i>

390
00:16:44.961 --> 00:16:48.871
He and his followers
are no longer
welcome in my float.

391
00:16:48.871 --> 00:16:51.119
Do with him
what you see fit.

392
00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.960
Very well...

393
00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.170
Kiburi. You
and your followers

394
00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:57.620
are banished
from the Pride Lands.

395
00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:00.170
Leave now,
and never come back.

396
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:03.209
But...
I said, now.

397
00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.330
Fine.

398
00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:07.670
But you haven't heard
the last of me!

399
00:17:11.539 --> 00:17:13.119
(CHITTERING)

400
00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.080
You!

401
00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:20.330
You said if we
attacked Simba,

402
00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:22.750
I could rule
the whole Pride Lands!

403
00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:25.290
Now what have I got?
Nothin'!

404
00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:26.419
Yes.

405
00:17:26.419 --> 00:17:29.749
It's too bad
you lost the <i>Mashindano.</i>

406
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:30.880
"Too bad?"

407
00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.710
Is that all you got
to say about it?

408
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:36.880
One battle
doesn't lose a war,
my reptile friend.

409
00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.379
Now you're
callin' me a reptile?

410
00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:42.380
Gimme one reason
I shouldn't eat you
right now.

411
00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:45.620
I can give you
all the reasons
in the Pride Lands.

412
00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:49.210
But first let me
show you something very...

413
00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:50.419
Very...

414
00:17:50.419 --> 00:17:52.879
Special.

415
00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.620
What kinda special?

416
00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:57.290
You'll have to
see it to believe it.

417
00:17:57.290 --> 00:17:59.330
This way...

418
00:18:02.749 --> 00:18:06.209
So what's this great thing
I'm supposed to see?

419
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.040
A volcano?

420
00:18:11.749 --> 00:18:15.749
I'm much more
than a volcano.

421
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:17.290
Wha... What?

422
00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:20.210
Welcome
to the Outlands, Kiburi.

423
00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:22.290
(LAUGHS)

424
00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:24.380
Yeah. Welcome!

425
00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:25.879
What's going on?

426
00:18:25.879 --> 00:18:30.119
Don't worry, Kiburi,
we're all friends here.

427
00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:33.580
I have plans for you
and your crocodiles.

428
00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:36.250
Big plans indeed!

429
00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:38.289

Yeah. Everyone knows
it was an accident.

465
00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.170
I know.

466
00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:34.500
But still...

467
00:20:34.541 --> 00:20:36.961
It's the only way
I'll feel okay
about what happened.

Excuse me.

Makuu?

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:47.380
Yes?

472
00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:51.250
Um, about the
crocodiles being awake
for the dry season?

473
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:54.999
Well, uh, as I'm sure
you know, it's...

474
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.380
It's all my fault.

475
00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:59.040
It is, isn't it?

476
00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.500
Yes, yes it is.

477
00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:01.619
And I...

478
00:21:01.619 --> 00:21:03.289
I just wanted to say...

479
00:21:03.289 --> 00:21:04.289
I'm sorry.

480
00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:07.500
I see.

481
00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:10.620
Then, as leader
of the crocodiles,

482
00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:13.420
I need to make
an example of you.

483
00:21:14.039 --> 00:21:16.329
Uh... You do?

484
00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:17.960
Yes.

485
00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.500
(WHIMPERS)

486
00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:21.670
I forgive you.

487
00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:23.920
Huh? You...

488
00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:27.499
You what?
You heard me.

489
00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:31.540
I told Makuu how your keen
sight foiled Kiburi's plan.

490
00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:33.580
We all make mistakes, Ono.

491
00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:37.540
But you also proved
yourself invaluable today.

492
00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:39.829
Thank you.
Oh! Well...

493
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:41.250
I mean...

494
00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:42.250
Thank you!

495
00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:44.380
So, Makuu,

496
00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:47.290
is this the new
"crocodile way?"

497
00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:49.170
Perhaps it is, Simba.

498
00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:51.619
Perhaps it is.

499
00:21:51.661 --> 00:21:55.661
If you ask me,
it's a crocodile way
I could get used to!

500
00:21:55.661 --> 00:21:57.210
A-ffirmative!
