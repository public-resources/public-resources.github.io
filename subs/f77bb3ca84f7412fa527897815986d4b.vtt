Yes! Every baobab tree
in Mizimu Grove

38
00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:48.540
was planted
by a Royal Mjuzi while
they were in training.

00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:02.500
I remember my dad
telling me about Rafiki's.

Ooh! Basi! You and your pod
are welcome to come too!

We'd love to.

47
00:03:07.881 --> 00:03:10.290
I'm sure it would lift
the whole pod's spirits.

48
00:03:10.291 --> 00:03:14.170
Actually, it sounds like
a chance to lift
everyone's spirits!

Kion?

50
00:03:15.001 --> 00:03:18.080
We should invite everyone

gonna want to watch

Not now, kid.
Kind of busy here.

57
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.290
It's about you two putting on
a show at Mizimu Grove.

59
00:03:39.121 --> 00:03:41.670
Well, why
didn't you say so
in the first place!

60
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.500
It's for Makini's <i>mpando mpya.</i>

61
00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:47.000
I think if we turn it
into a big event,

62
00:03:47.001 --> 00:03:48.880
it might cheer everyone up.

63
00:03:48.881 --> 00:03:51.580
Maybe you two could
start it off with a song?

64
00:03:51.581 --> 00:03:54.000
Ooh! That sounds like fun!

65
00:03:54.001 --> 00:03:55.880

66
00:03:55.881 --> 00:03:59.170
Nothin' like a song and dance
to liven things up!

67
00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:01.080
Then you'll do it?
Of course we will!

68
00:04:01.081 --> 00:04:04.540

to be so amazing!

to miss a show like this!

gathered in one place

80

at the Lion Guard's request.

81
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.750

to a few uninvited guests.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.790

Things have been bad
since Scar returned.

334

But I never thought
it would be so bad

335

that the Pride Landers
would want to leave.

336

I know they just want
to protect their herds,

337
00:18:31.171 --> 00:18:33.620

to protect them, too.

338

I guess I feel
like I failed.

(ZEBRAS NEIGH)

350
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.040
(GRUNTING)

351
00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.710
The hippos have
reached a decision.
Dad?

352
00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.580
It looks like...
KION: Pride Landers! Wait!

353
00:19:36.581 --> 00:19:37.580
Kion?

354
00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:44.330
Everyone, please.
If you decide to leave,
I understand.

355
00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:46.210
But before you do,

356
00:19:46.211 --> 00:19:47.920
there's something
I'd like to show you.

357
00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:56.960
Here.

358
00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:58.620
(GASPS)

359
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:05.000
Oh!

360
00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:11.330
Makini's tiny sapling
survived the attack
on Mizimu Grove.

361
00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.670
And if it survived here,

362
00:20:13.671 --> 00:20:16.040
there's no reason
we all can't.

363
00:20:16.041 --> 00:20:19.000
If we stay together,
we'll be stronger.

364
00:20:19.001 --> 00:20:23.170
Yes, Scar has returned.
And I know you're scared.

365
00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:28.170
But the last time
Scar was around,
there wasn't a Lion Guard.

366
00:20:28.171 --> 00:20:31.210
There is now.
And we're here to protect you.

367
00:20:31.211 --> 00:20:34.210
Even on the darkest day,
there's hope.

368
00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.170
Kion's right.

369
00:20:36.171 --> 00:20:38.790
We're stronger
if we stay together.

370
00:20:38.791 --> 00:20:40.080
We do have hope.

371
00:20:40.081 --> 00:20:42.420
The hippos
are here to stay.

372
00:20:42.421 --> 00:20:43.580
<i>Poa.</i>

373
00:20:43.581 --> 00:20:45.460
So are the elephants!
(TRUMPETS)

374
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.080
Giraffes too!

375
00:20:47.081 --> 00:20:48.710
As are the zebras.

376
00:20:48.711 --> 00:20:50.290
And the aardvarks.

377
00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:52.210
Count the galagos in!

378
00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:57.290
(SIGHS) The antelopes
will be staying as well.

379
00:20:57.291 --> 00:20:59.120
I'm happy to hear that.

380
00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:02.080
Uh, what do we do now?

381
00:21:02.081 --> 00:21:04.170
What else, honey badger?

382
00:21:04.171 --> 00:21:07.040
We have Makini's <i>Mpando mpya!</i>

383
00:21:07.041 --> 00:21:09.750
Ooh, can we? Right now?

384
00:21:09.751 --> 00:21:13.500
I can't think
of a better way
to celebrate this moment.

385
00:21:13.501 --> 00:21:17.040
(ALL CHEER)

386
00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:23.290
Too bad Timon
and Pumbaa aren't here
to sing their song.

387
00:21:23.291 --> 00:21:25.500
They're still
at Hakuna Matata Falls.

388
00:21:25.501 --> 00:21:27.750
Somethin' about needin'
beauty rest?

389
00:21:27.751 --> 00:21:30.210
I think I can
help you out there.
