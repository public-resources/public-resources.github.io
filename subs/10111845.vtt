The galagos are in trouble!

178
00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:17.710
Oh, no!

179
00:09:17.711 --> 00:09:18.460
Lead the way, Ono!

182

Don't make me use
my crocodile moves.
(GRUNTS)

183
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:31.120
Relax, gecko.
We come in peace.

184
00:09:31.121 --> 00:09:33.580
Though I couldn't help
but overhear...

185
00:09:33.581 --> 00:09:36.000
Makuu doesn't want you
in his float?

186
00:09:36.001 --> 00:09:38.210
Yeah, I don't blame him.

187
00:09:38.211 --> 00:09:41.000
A gecko in a crocodile float
is ridiculous.

188
00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.540
Ah, I should just
forget the whole thing.

189
00:09:44.541 --> 00:09:47.580
I wouldn't give up
so easily, if I were you.

190
00:09:47.581 --> 00:09:48.880
Why not?

191
00:09:48.881 --> 00:09:51.960
Makuu doesn't have
the only float around,
you know.

192
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:57.120
In fact,
I know a croc who would
love to have you in his float.

193
00:09:57.121 --> 00:09:58.670
You do? He would?

194
00:09:58.671 --> 00:10:00.170
Sure.

195
00:10:00.171 --> 00:10:04.210
He knows how much
a bright, young gecko
has to offer.

196
00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:05.620
You wanna meet him?

197
00:10:05.621 --> 00:10:08.710
Sure!
Njano, why don't you
go on ahead?

198
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:13.330
Tell Kiburi
what a special candidate
we have for his float.

199
00:10:13.331 --> 00:10:14.500
Good idea.

200
00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.670
Come on, Hodari.
Let's go.

201
00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:22.620
LAINI: Help! Help!

202
00:10:22.621 --> 00:10:25.620
Laini and two other galagos
are under the tree hollow.

203
00:10:25.621 --> 00:10:29.210
Are they okay?
They're fine,
but they're stuck.

204
00:10:29.211 --> 00:10:30.250
Not for long.

Yay! We're free!
Whoo-hoo!

208
00:10:41.961 --> 00:10:42.960
Laini?

209
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:45.620
Ooh, you're not a galago.

210
00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:47.830
Bunga, focus.

211
00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.830
Whoo! We're free!

212
00:10:52.831 --> 00:10:54.000
Thank you, Lion Guard.

213
00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:56.670
No problem, Laini.

214
00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.750
It's what we do.

215
00:10:58.751 --> 00:11:01.710
KION: All right, Lion Guard.
Let's get back on patrol.

216
00:11:01.711 --> 00:11:04.170
See you!
Watch out for falling trees!

217
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:07.960
Trust me, this guy's gonna
be great for your float!

218
00:11:07.961 --> 00:11:10.960
He knows all about
Makuu and his crocs.

219
00:11:10.961 --> 00:11:12.920
And all
their fighting techniques.

220
00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.580
So do I.

221
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:19.000
But what good does that do me
if the Lion Guard won't let me
back into the Pride Lands?

222
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.790
This guy's a friend
of the Lion Guard.

223
00:11:21.791 --> 00:11:23.880
I'll bet he can help you
get past 'em.

224
00:11:23.881 --> 00:11:26.620
A crocodile that's friends
with the Lion Guard?

225
00:11:26.621 --> 00:11:27.620
Interesting.

226
00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.710
And here he is.

227
00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.710
I thought you said
he was a crocodile.

228
00:11:35.711 --> 00:11:37.670
No, you said that.

229
00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.500
Trust me.

230
00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.710
You can totally use this guy
to take down Makuu.

231
00:11:42.711 --> 00:11:43.790
Hmm.

232
00:11:43.791 --> 00:11:46.920
Njano tells me you wanna
be part of my float.

233
00:11:46.921 --> 00:11:49.330
Yes. It's my dream.

Yeah. His dream was
to join Makuu's float.

it doesn't, right?

Didn't you hear Kiburi?
I'm part of his float now.

310
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Why did you chase them away?

311
00:15:06.001 --> 00:15:08.880
'Cause Simba banished them
to the Outlands after they
tried to take him down.

But you said I should join
a crocodile float.

00:15:18.921 --> 00:15:21.750
Now that I did,
you're saying I'm a bad guy?

00:15:21.751 --> 00:15:23.080
I'm not saying you're bad...

319
00:15:23.081 --> 00:15:26.920
Yes, you are. You said
I should follow my dreams,
and I did.

320
00:15:26.921 --> 00:15:28.750
Maybe you're not my friend
after all.

00:15:28.751 --> 00:15:30.500
No, Hodari! Wait!

322
00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.420
I thought the gecko was gonna
get us past the Lion Guard.

323
00:15:38.421 --> 00:15:41.080
At least he stalled 'em.
They looked confused.

324
00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.790
We just have to move fast
and take down Makuu

00:15:43.791 --> 00:15:46.960
before the Lion Guard
even knows
we're in the Pride Lands.

Hodari? We thought maybe
you decided to stay
with your Lion Guard friends.

00:15:54.541 --> 00:15:57.620
They're not
my friends anymore.
I'm with your float now.

do us any good.

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.960
It might. Watch.

332
00:16:02.961 --> 00:16:06.620
Hodari, you have so many
crocodile moves.

333
00:16:06.621 --> 00:16:09.330
You gotta tell us
everything you learned
from Makuu's float.

334
00:16:09.331 --> 00:16:11.120
Oh, wow. There's so much.

335
00:16:11.121 --> 00:16:13.080
You should see the new moves
they're working on.

336
00:16:13.081 --> 00:16:15.250
Like the Wide... Tailspin!

337
00:16:15.251 --> 00:16:17.250
Most of the crocs can't
do it as good as me.

338
00:16:17.251 --> 00:16:20.790
Oh, and Makuu has been doing
this crazy new move.

339
00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:24.210
But I don't think
he can do that move.

340
00:16:24.211 --> 00:16:25.420
His front leg is hurt
pretty bad.

341
00:16:25.421 --> 00:16:28.670
Oh, oh, and there's
this move, too!

342
00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.710
But I don't think he can do
that one, either.

343

And Hodari's with Kiburi now.

355
00:17:06.081 --> 00:17:07.710
I wouldn't want him
to get hurt.

356

If he wants to be with
crocodiles, he'll have
to take his chances.

360

We can stick around
in case Kiburi comes back.

We don't need your help.

of ourselves.

Well, okay.

364

We'll give the Lion Guard
time to move off.

Then it's payback time.

Thought we were just going
to get water.

Oh, don't worry.
We'll get the water.
