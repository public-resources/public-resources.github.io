KION: No time to slow down.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.750
We need to stop Zira
and her evil lions

6
00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:14.710
before they can harm
the Pride Lands.

7
00:01:14.711 --> 00:01:16.120

We thought we'd never
see you again.

Oh, come on, fur brains.
We wasn't gone that long.

13
00:01:29.251 --> 00:01:31.580
Madoa, do you know where
Zira and her lions are?

14
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.580
They went
into the Pride Lands,

15
00:01:33.581 --> 00:01:36.210
not long after Jasiri
and Janja left to find you.

16
00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:38.120
We don't know what
happened after that.

17
00:01:38.121 --> 00:01:40.620
We promised Jasiri we'd
stay away from Zira,

18
00:01:40.621 --> 00:01:41.920
so we've been hiding.

19
00:01:41.921 --> 00:01:44.040
It's okay.
You did the right thing.

20
00:01:44.041 --> 00:01:46.380
But if Zira's lions
are still in the
Pride Lands,

21
00:01:46.381 --> 00:01:47.670
something's up.

22
00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:50.620
Yeah, we need to return
to the Pride Lands
and see what's happened.

23
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.080
And we'll need as much
help as we can get.

24

My hyenas will be
happy to help.

Welcome back.

29
00:02:03.831 --> 00:02:07.080
Your presence
in the Outlands has
been greatly missed.

31
00:02:08.671 --> 00:02:11.170
Kion needs our help
to ensure peace
in the Pride Lands.

Would you
and the vultures
join us?

33

All in favor of rendering
assistance to Kion

34

Jasiri's request.

honored to help.

41
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.330
Kind of weird leading
an army of Outlanders
into the Pride Lands.

42
00:02:41.331 --> 00:02:43.790
Yeah, I hadn't thought
of it like that.

43
00:02:43.791 --> 00:02:45.120
What if Zira's pride
is still...

44
00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:46.120
ANGA: Kion!

45
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.580
I see a strange lion
on Pride Rock.

46
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.290
Dark fur, green eyes.

47
00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:54.460
That's Kovu,
Zira's son.

48
00:02:54.461 --> 00:02:56.960
Anga, is Kovu alone?

49
00:02:56.961 --> 00:02:59.210
Yes. No sign
of the Royal Family.

50
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.080
You think
we're too late?

51
00:03:01.081 --> 00:03:02.580
No, we can't be.

52
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.170
But if Kovu is
at Pride Rock,
it means...

53
00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:08.210
It means you Outlanders
don't stand a chance.

54
00:03:08.211 --> 00:03:10.960
It's Zira's
daughter, Vitani,
and her lionesses.

That's right, hyena.

56

146
00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.040

Queen Jana.

148
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.420
Queen Jana was right.

149
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:12.000
She was certain Makini's
rightful place would be
at the Tree of Life.

150
00:07:12.001 --> 00:07:15.790
Just as I was certain
Makini's role
would be here,

151
00:07:15.791 --> 00:07:17.170
in the Pride Lands.

152
00:07:17.171 --> 00:07:20.080
I think we all found
something special
at the Tree of Life.

153
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.040
But when we heard Zira was
headed for the Pride Lands,

154
00:07:24.041 --> 00:07:25.670
we came back
as fast as we could.

155
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.580
So, what happened?

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:29.960

00:07:29.961 --> 00:07:31.920

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.040
RAFIKI: After Kion roared
Zira's pride

160
00:07:37.041 --> 00:07:39.000
out of the Outlands,

161
00:07:39.001 --> 00:07:43.170
Zira devised a new plan
to take over the Pride Lands.

162
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.540
KOVU: Zira raised me
to believe that Simba
was our enemy.

163
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.670
But after I got to know
Simba and Kiara,

164
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:52.210
I realized she was wrong.

165
00:07:52.211 --> 00:07:55.500
VITANI: So Zira led an attack
on the Pride Lands herself.

166
00:07:55.501 --> 00:07:57.620
But Kovu and I
tried to stop her.

167
00:07:57.621 --> 00:07:59.540
We said we didn't
need to fight

168
00:07:59.541 --> 00:08:02.250
because,
as lions, we are one.

169
00:08:02.251 --> 00:08:04.670
KOVU: Vitani and the other
lions saw it was true,

170
00:08:04.671 --> 00:08:08.000
but Zira refused,
and in the end,
it destroyed her.

171
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.790
After Zira was gone,
Simba welcomed us
into his pride.

172
00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:15.040
And one day,
Kiara and Kovu

173
00:08:15.041 --> 00:08:17.880
will be queen and king
of the Pride Lands.

174
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.420
We really did miss a lot.

175
00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:23.250
You did, and we have
missed you. All of you.

176
00:08:23.251 --> 00:08:25.500
And we are not
the only ones.

177
00:08:25.501 --> 00:08:26.880
(LAUGHS) Look.

178
00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:29.000

Yeah.

187

Those four stars
helped us find our way
to the Tree of Life.

188

Seeing you with Kovu

189
00:10:11.001 --> 00:10:13.000
reminded me of a friend
I made there.

190
00:10:13.001 --> 00:10:14.250
A friend?

191
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:16.500
Ooh. What's her name?

192
00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.670
Rani. Queen Rani.

193
00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.170
Oh, a queen.

194
00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:25.000
She's smart, brave,
but also kind.

195
00:10:25.001 --> 00:10:26.080
A great leader.

196
00:10:26.081 --> 00:10:27.790
You'd like her.

197
00:10:27.791 --> 00:10:29.170
Sounds like you do, too.

198
00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.170
You miss her, don't you?

199
00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:34.500
Yeah, I do.

200
00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:38.750
Maybe you can go back
to the Tree of Life someday.

201
00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.120
Yeah.

202
00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.290
I think Mom and Dad
would understand.

203
00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:44.210
Maybe.

204
00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:47.790
KION: So you think
the Lair's changed much
since we've been gone?

205
00:10:47.791 --> 00:10:49.000
Why would it?

206
00:10:49.001 --> 00:10:51.580
Ooh, I wonder if the grubs
that I hid are still there.

you doing here?

I'm the future

212

It's my duty to lead
the Lion Guard.

213

Vitani, I'm the future
queen's brother.

We have the Mark of the Guard,
and I have the Roar.

Yes, seriously.

We're back in

Okay, guys,
you know what to do.

Hmm.

Why, thank you.
I hadn't thought
of that.

Oh.

No thanks to us.

We can't help anyone
if we keep arguing.

249

You're right. So why don't
you and your friends
leave things to us now?

We're not gonna
do that.

251
00:12:37.421 --> 00:12:39.210
Our team is
the Pride Lands' best.

252
00:12:39.211 --> 00:12:41.210
Our team is the best.

253
00:12:41.211 --> 00:12:43.120
Excuse me.

254
00:12:43.121 --> 00:12:45.790
If you really want
to see who's best,

255
00:12:45.791 --> 00:12:48.330
you should to it
the zebra way.

256
00:12:48.331 --> 00:12:49.420
And what's that?

257
00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:51.670
You have a competition.

258
00:12:51.671 --> 00:12:54.210
We zebras find
the best zebra

259
00:12:54.211 --> 00:12:57.040
by seeing who can panic
and run the best.

As weird as it sounds,
he might be right.

261
00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:03.710
Yeah, we can do the big test
of the original Lion Guard
setup in the Lair.

262
00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.710
Bunga,
that wouldn't be fair.

263
00:13:05.711 --> 00:13:07.750
Our Lion Guard already
took that test.

264
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:11.750
But both guards could compete
in a series of new challenges

265
00:13:11.751 --> 00:13:13.080
to see which team
is the best.

266
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.920
Seems fair.

267

deserve the best.

of the Lion Guards.

compete with Vitani's

to see which team
is the best.

279
00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.670
There will be one test
for each traditional
Lion Guard role,

280
00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:55.580
the fiercest,
bravest, fastest,

281

loses their challenge

will get to set the rules
for the next one.

Vitani, as leader
of the challenging team,

287

your guard
will have first choice.

Okay, strongest first.
Imara?

To prove who is strongest,

290
00:14:19.171 --> 00:14:21.790
Beshte and I will
have to push a rock

291

do that in his sleep.

Nope.

Too bad Anga's not here.

359

I don't need
