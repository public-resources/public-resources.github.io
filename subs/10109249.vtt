00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.670
RAFIKI: And this is
the Kupatana Celebration,

2
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.290
when everyone
in the Pride Lands
gathers in peace

3
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.209
to watch
the baobab flowers bloom.

4
00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:13.959
Oh! It's so pretty, Rafiki!

5
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.040
(CHUCKLES) Yes, Makini.
And as Royal Mjuzi,

6
00:00:18.081 --> 00:00:21.161
you will need to know
all of the Pride Lands'
celebrations.

7
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.790
Oh, good! 'Cause I want to
learn all the Pride Lands
celebrations!

8
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.210
What's this one, Rafiki?
Is that Timon?

9
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.500
Ah, yes, it is.

10
00:00:29.541 --> 00:00:33.251
Timon is placing a star fruit
at the top
of his Christmas tree.

11
00:00:33.251 --> 00:00:35.830
Christmas tree?
But it looks like
an acacia tree.

12
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.960
(CHUCKLES) Of course!
You are new
to the Pride Lands.

13
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.420
You have not yet celebrated
Christmas with us.

14
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.080
Christmas? What's Christmas?

15
00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:47.619
It is the most wonderful
celebration of all.

16
00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:50.119
Would you like to hear
the story of how

17
00:00:50.161 --> 00:00:53.161
Timon and Pumbaa introduced
Christmas to the Pride Lands?

18
00:00:53.161 --> 00:00:56.750
Oh, yes!
Please, please, please!

19
00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.249
Very well.

20
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.790
It begins with the appearance
of a special star
high in the sky.

21
00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:09.291
<i>On the day before Christmas,
a star shines so bright.</i>

22
00:01:09.291 --> 00:01:13.120
<i>All over the Pride Lands,
it is seen day and night.</i>

23
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.170

<i>♪ Jungle smells,

<i>♪ Oh, what fun it is to... ♪</i>

26
00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:35.209
PUMBAA: Uh, Timon?

27
00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:37.579
That's not the way
I remember the song.

28
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.080
Come on, Pumbaa.
How can you not remember?

29
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.880
We sing it every Christmas.

30
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.250
I-I know, but...

31
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.670
There! Pumbaa? Bunga?
Whaddaya think, eh?

32
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:49.710
Let's see.

33
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.330
Oh, it's beautiful, Timon.

34
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.380
Yeah, Uncle Timon,
it's perfect.

35
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.380
Almost perfect.

36
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.879
We still need the star fruit
for the top of the tree.

37
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.580
One star fruit, coming up.

38
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:05.920
Here you go.

39
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.380
Thanks, Bunga.

40
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.120
Now for
the "piece de resistance!"

41
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.330
There. All done.

42
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.250
(YELLING)

43
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.250
Oh, Timon!

44
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.170
I gotcha! <i>Zuka Zama!</i>

45
00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:22.539
Whoops.

46
00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:24.459
(GROANS)

47
00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.620
Thanks, Beshte.

48
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.790
We heard you shouting.
Good thing we were close by.

49
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.790
Why were you
in that tree, anyway?

50
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.540
And why are there gourds
hanging all over it?

51
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.750
Because it's a Christmas tree.
See that big star up there?

52
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.460
That means
tomorrow is Christmas.

53
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.080
<i>Poa!</i>

54
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.500
Uh, what's Christmas?

55
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.789
BOTH: "What's Christmas"?

56
00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.669
It's this great holiday
my uncles made up.

57
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.420
Ho, ho, no!
We did not make it up!

58
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.540
Timon's right.

59
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.380
We heard about it from an ox,

60
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.330
who heard it
from a yellow wagtail,

61
00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.419
who heard it
from a flying reindeer!

62
00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:01.459
Flying reindeer?
Reindeer don't...

63
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.750
The point is,

64
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:07.161
Christmas is a wonderful day
when we all get presents!

65
00:03:07.161 --> 00:03:10.421
It's more like a time to be
with your friends and family.

66
00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:13.499
It's all about
the spirit of giving!

67
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.380
You mean "getting."

68
00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.830
I'm pretty sure
it's "giving."

69
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.670
Actually, you can't have
getting without giving.

70
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.289
Or giving without getting.

71
00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:25.619
But you know what
the best part of Christmas is?

72
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.500
Dandy Claws!

73
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.290
Dandy Claws?
Is that a who or a what?

74
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.920
Oh! He's a big red guy
with fluffy white whiskers.

75
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.620
And on Christmas morning,
he leaves lots of presents
under the Christmas tree!

76
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.330
Yeah, Christmas is the best!

Yes. That is, well...

123
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.960
No.

124
00:06:04.001 --> 00:06:08.251
Dandy Claws has never come.
And I'm afraid he never will.

125
00:06:08.251 --> 00:06:10.330
(CRYING)

126
00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:12.209
Why not?

127
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.460
Well, from what we've heard,
Dandy Claws only comes

128
00:06:17.501 --> 00:06:22.501
if you perform a special song
under the Christmas tree
on Christmas morning.

129
00:06:22.829 --> 00:06:25.539
It's called <i>The Twelve Ways
of Christmas.</i>

130
00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.250
It's got leaping lions,
bouncing berries,

131
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.750
falling fruit,
all sorts of stuff.

132
00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.460
Yeah, but you can't
just sing about 'em!

133
00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.919
They gotta be there!
It's a huge production!

134
00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.170
Animals, fruit, bugs.

135
00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.500
It's too much.

136
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.670
I've tried, but I've never
been able to do it.

137
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.500
It's impossible!

138
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:52.870
And that's why Dandy Claws
will never come
and bring me gifts!

139
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.540
Oh, cheer up, Timon.

140
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.330
Bunga and I give you gifts
every Christmas.

141
00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:59.459
Yeah!

142
00:06:59.459 --> 00:07:01.539
I know,
and they're always great.

143
00:07:01.581 --> 00:07:06.041
But just once,
I'd like Dandy Claws
to bring me something, too.

144
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:09.750
Well, who knows?
Maybe someday he will.

145
00:07:10.329 --> 00:07:12.579
(SIGHS) Maybe.

146
00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:18.170
Okay. Well, time for one more
patrol before Christmas.

147
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:19.790
Bunga, you coming?

148
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:20.790
Okay.

149
00:07:21.709 --> 00:07:24.459
See ya, Uncle Pumbaa.
Bye, Uncle Timon.

150
00:07:24.459 --> 00:07:25.879
So long, Bunga.

151
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.380
Yeah, see ya.

152
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:30.920
(SIGHS)

153
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.460
You okay, Little B?

154
00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.210
Yeah, I just wish I could
make Dandy Claws appear

155
00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:37.789
and have Uncle Timon's
Christmas dream come true.

156
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.500
Well, maybe we can.

157
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.080
But we'd have to do
that song.

158
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.960
<i>The Twelve Ways
of Christmas?</i>

159
00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:44.830
Timon said it's impossible.

160
00:07:44.871 --> 00:07:48.831
And tomorrow's Christmas!
We'd have to get everything
ready today!

161
00:07:48.831 --> 00:07:50.539
So? We're the Lion Guard.

162
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:52.710
We do the impossible
all the time.

163
00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:55.620
Ooh, yeah, we do,
don't we?

164
00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:56.790
Okay, Little B, I'm in.

165
00:07:57.789 --> 00:07:58.879
Me, too.

166
00:07:58.879 --> 00:08:00.249
Affirmative.

167
00:08:00.249 --> 00:08:02.039
Yes! Thanks, everybody.

168
00:08:02.541 --> 00:08:06.621
Okay. Bunga, what do we need
for <i>The Twelve Ways
of Christmas?</i>

169
00:08:06.621 --> 00:08:07.960
Oh, so much!

170
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.000
Bugs a-crawling,
fruit a-falling,

171
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.669
lions leaping,
trunks a-honking...

172
00:08:11.669 --> 00:08:14.119
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I never thought I'd say this,

173
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.420
but slow down!

174
00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.710
Maybe you should start
from the beginning.

175
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:21.210
Okay, so the song
goes like this.

176
00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:25.040
<i>♪ For the First Way
of Christmas,
my good friends gave to me</i>

177
00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:32.250
<i>♪ In a baobab tree ♪</i>

178
00:08:33.879 --> 00:08:35.709
And that's it.
What do you think?

179
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:40.000
Sounds like a big job,
but if we split up,
I think we can do it.

180
00:08:40.001 --> 00:08:42.921
We'll divide up
the things and animals
we have to gather,

181
00:08:42.921 --> 00:08:44.540
and meet back
at Hakuna Matata Falls.

182
00:08:44.871 --> 00:08:49.961
Sure! This is gonna be
the most un-Bunga-lievable
Christmas ever!

183
00:08:49.961 --> 00:08:51.790
Ooh, but don't let Timon
and Pumbaa see you!

184
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:53.500
I really want it
to be a surprise!

185
00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.460
Dandy Claws? I don't like
the sound of that.

186
00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:58.919
I think it sounds like fun.

187
00:08:59.209 --> 00:09:02.039
Can we, Ma Tembo? Please?

188
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.000
What was it you said
we'd be doing?

189
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:05.830
Um, a-honking?

190
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.790
Hear that?
It's a performance!

191
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:11.540
Hmm. I do love to perform.

192
00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:13.119
And Beshte's like family.

193
00:09:13.661 --> 00:09:17.331
We elephants would be
delighted to be in your
Christmas performance.

194
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:19.790
Yay! (TRUMPETS)

195
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.750
<i>Poa!</i> It'll be great!

196
00:09:23.039 --> 00:09:24.709
SIMBA: You want me
to do what?

197
00:09:25.249 --> 00:09:26.999
Oh, come on, Dad,
please?

198
00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:29.330
It's for Timon and Pumbaa.

199
00:09:29.371 --> 00:09:32.081
Just think of all
they've done for you
over the years, Simba.

200
00:09:32.081 --> 00:09:34.750
And besides,
you might enjoy yourself.

201
00:09:35.039 --> 00:09:37.539
Mom's right, Dad.
I think you'll have fun.

202
00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:40.420
Fine, I'll be in your song.

203
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:41.750
Thanks, Dad.

204
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:44.290
But if I'm going to do it,
so are you.

205
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:45.710
Both of you.

206
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.830
Actually, we need all of you.
And Tiifu and Zuri, too.

207
00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:52.120
Great! We can all
leap together!

208
00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.330
Kion, you can count on us.

209
00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.620
Thanks, everybody.
Now I gotta go.

210
00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:59.380
You won't believe
all the things we need
for this song!

211
00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:00.829
And Merry Christmas!

212
00:10:00.829 --> 00:10:03.669
Uh, Merry Christmas?

213
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:05.420
Merry Christmas, Kion.

214
00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.080
Yes, whatever that means.

215
00:10:09.749 --> 00:10:10.879
Ooh!

<i>♪ Nine bugs a-crawling! ♪</i>

217
00:10:12.539 --> 00:10:15.919
Big, fat, juicy,
delicious-looking bugs.

218
00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.830
Bunga? You're saving those
for the song, right?

219
00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:21.080
(SIGHS) Yeah.

220
00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.170
PUMBAA:
<i>♪ For the First Way

223
00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:27.920

Oh, hi, fellas.

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:34.670
Hi, Uncle Pumbaa.

228
00:10:35.119 --> 00:10:36.209
Whatcha up to?

229
00:10:36.209 --> 00:10:37.709
Nothing. Just hangin' out.

Not looking for anything
squirmy, what you doing?

231
00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:43.540
Oh, who, me? Uh, nothing.

232
00:10:43.831 --> 00:10:48.711
I'm definitely not lookin' for
a special Christmas surprise
for Timon, I'll tell ya that.

233
00:10:48.711 --> 00:10:50.539
Yeah, us neither.

234
00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:53.750
Well, me and Ono got, uh,
Lion Guard stuff to do.

235
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:54.880
Talk to ya later.

236
00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.250
Okay. See ya, Bunga.

237
00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:00.290
Ooh. White flowers. Perfect.

Hey! I thought we were
saving 'em for the song!

240
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:07.750
You put them in my mouth!

241
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:09.790
But I didn't say
you could swallow 'em.

242
00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:12.579
(SIGHS) Guess we gotta
start all over.

243
00:11:13.419 --> 00:11:14.919

244
00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.960
How did I get stuck
with gathering berries?

Oh, yeah. I remember you.

252
00:11:33.621 --> 00:11:36.621
Looks like you could
use some help
reaching those berries!

253
00:11:36.621 --> 00:11:39.619

Yeah, I guess I could.

254
00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:42.330
Come on, fellas.
Help the cheetah out.

255
00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:00.960
I never thought I'd say this,
but thank you, baboons.

256
00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:03.669
So, what do you need
the berries for?

257
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:05.790
They're for, uh,
a performance.

258
00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:07.960
Kinda silly,
but it's for a friend.

259
00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:11.420
You know,
we need some baboons, too.

260
00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:13.919
Something else
I never thought I'd say.

261
00:12:13.919 --> 00:12:16.919
A performance, huh?
We are intrigued.

262
00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.170
Tell us more, please.

263
00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:22.080
Okay, well, have you ever
heard of Christmas?

264
00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:30.250
Hmm. That is one
strange-looking acacia tree.

265
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.880
It's pretty, though.

266
00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.790
It must be the Christmas Tree
Kion told us about.

267
00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:37.169
Hey, you made it.

268
00:12:37.499 --> 00:12:39.209
Are we the first ones here?

Uh, not exactly. Come on!

Oh, my.
This is a big production.

you gotta pay attention,

272

'cause we've only got till
sunrise to get this right.

273
00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.790

for the performance.

What do we do?

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.540
Oh. Hi, Your Highnesses.

281
00:13:12.999 --> 00:13:14.829
Didn't see you there.

282
00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:17.420
Don't let us interrupt you,
Bunga. You were saying?

283
00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:18.920
Uh, yeah.

284
00:13:18.961 --> 00:13:23.121
So, we need to do the song
perfectly if we want
Dandy Claws to show up!

285
00:13:23.121 --> 00:13:23.919
But no pressure.

286
00:13:23.919 --> 00:13:25.999
Right, right.
No pressure.

287
00:13:25.999 --> 00:13:28.249
Don't worry, Little B.
It's gonna be great.

288
00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:30.710
Wait.
Who's Dandy Claws again?

289
00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:34.250
The rest of you remember
Dandy Claws, right?

ALL: No!

291
00:13:36.249 --> 00:13:38.329

to be perfect.

The sun's about to come up.

If we haven't learned it
by now,

I don't know if we ever will.

303
00:14:11.079 --> 00:14:12.749
Oh, well, we gave it a try.

304
00:14:13.039 --> 00:14:13.999
Maybe next year.

305
00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:18.540

Christmas thing anyway.

No. Wait.
Everybody, stop!

like this.

Kion, Bunga, what's so
important about this...
"Christmas"?

312
00:14:33.461 --> 00:14:37.001
Well, Pumbaa says Christmas
is all about the spirit
of giving.

313
00:14:37.001 --> 00:14:40.169
And him and Uncle Timon
are the only family I have.

314
00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:42.710
They took me in
when I was little,
and all alone.

315
00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.460
They took you in, too.

316
00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.880
Yes, they did.

317
00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.579
They've given me everything.

318
00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:52.250
So this Christmas, I wanna
give them a performance
they won't forget.

319
00:14:52.661 --> 00:14:57.331
Okay, Bunga.
Then that is exactly
what we are going to do.
