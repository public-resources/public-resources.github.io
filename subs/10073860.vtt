rid of all the water!

walk off the island.

to use a boulder
as a stepping stone?

361
00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:06.040
Sounds like
a good plan.

362
00:16:06.081 --> 00:16:09.791
Yes. Unfortunately,
it collapsed part of
the island into the water.

363
00:16:09.791 --> 00:16:11.120
Just like our tree did.

364
00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.959
They were both
good plans.

365
00:16:12.959 --> 00:16:14.539
Just not good enough.

366
00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.880
Hmm, I wonder...

367
00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.790

together...
