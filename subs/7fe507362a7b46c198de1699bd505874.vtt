Yeah. Thanks, Makini.

No. I don't think so.

I put it on this log.

You're welcome.

198
00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.880
You really think
some porcupine stole
Makini's staff?

199
00:08:58.881 --> 00:09:00.040
Maybe.

200
00:09:00.041 --> 00:09:04.000
Anga, see if you can
spot porcupines
with Makini's staff.

201
00:09:04.001 --> 00:09:06.580
Yup.
Oh, I'm so sorry, Kion.

202
00:09:06.581 --> 00:09:08.710
My staff had
the rest of our Tuliza.

203
00:09:08.711 --> 00:09:11.170
And nobody here
will help us find Tuliza.

204
00:09:11.171 --> 00:09:13.290
It's okay, Maki...
But what if you
need some more?

205
00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.880
And my staff makes
the <i> moja kwa moja</i> paintings
come to life, too.

Makini, it's not your...

is in the Pride Lands.

Any sign
of the staff thieves?

Nope. Too many trees

What do you think, Fuli?

216
00:09:45.581 --> 00:09:50.080
Uh, well, we do need
Makini's staff to find
our way to the Tree of Life.

217
00:09:50.081 --> 00:09:51.710
We could ask the animals
who live here.

218

Maybe they know
who took it.

You mean, the animals
that run away every time
we talk to them?

a missing staff.

A staff? What's that?

229
00:10:16.291 --> 00:10:19.500
It's a stick, with a couple
of gourds hanging on it.

Uh, why would somebody
hang gourds on a stick?
