Yeah. I wonder
what's going on.

Look at that!

27
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.420
I've never seen so many
birds in one place.

28
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.749
So what are they
all doing here?

29
00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:13.619
I bet Ono could tell us.

30
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.670
But I don't know where he is.
ONO: I'm right here!

31
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.330
I got us a spot
right in front!

32

In front of what?

33
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.170
Let's find out.

34
00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:25.379

he's really back?

The legendary eagle?

40
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.000
Every bird in the Pride Lands
has heard of him!

41
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.459
Uh, Ono,
we aren't birds!

42
00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:40.621
But you don't
have to be a bird
to have heard of Hadithi.

I think.

46

I've always wanted to ask
Hadithi exactly how it goes.

47
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.920
And now I can.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.880
If I can get up
the nerve, that is.

49

he speaks,

54
00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:02.749
nuggets of wisdom fall
from his mouth.

55
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.790
Pfft! Big deal.

We all know, Hadithi
is a bird who never
thinks of himself.

Especially when
an animal needs help.

When a hero like Hadithi
returns to the Pride Lands,

158
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.750
it is important for us
to mark the occasion.

159

we'd like to honor you
at Pride Rock

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:15.580
For me?

163
00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.830

What's a Royal
Mud Print ceremony?

166
00:07:23.459 --> 00:07:25.919
Hadithi will press
his talons into wet mud!

167
00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.080
When it dries, his prints
will be preserved forever

168

alongside those
of other heroes!

169
00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:32.880

seen the ceremony.

think of anyone
who deserves it more.

And as guest of honor,

173
00:07:40.461 --> 00:07:43.541
it is tradition
that you share
your great knowledge

174
00:07:43.541 --> 00:07:46.250
with a younger member
of the Pride lands.

175
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:48.829

of you, King Simba.

182
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.040
But, I don't need much.

183
00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.170
Very well.

184
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:09.460
Although, uh,
speaking of tradition,

185
00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.379
as guest of honor,

186
00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:15.500
I assume that you'll be
building me the traditional
ceremonial nest?

187
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.580
The ceremonial nest?

188
00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.330
Hmm. I've never
heard of that.

189
00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:22.170
But we've also never had
a mud print ceremony

190
00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:23.959
for an eagle before.

191
00:08:23.959 --> 00:08:25.379
That's true.

192
00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.290
Birds do these things
differently.

193
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:29.040
The Lion Guard
would be honored

194
00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.250
to build the traditional
ceremonial nest!

195
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.120
Uh... Wouldn't we?

196
00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.500
Uh...

197
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.119
Sure.
Honored.

198
00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.540
Then we shall see you
at the clearing
by Pride Rock

199
00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:41.330
just before sundown
for the ceremony.

200
00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:46.620
Thank you, Lion Guard,
for your kind offer.

201
00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.329
Aw, what's a little
favor among heroes?

202
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:53.790
I assume you know how
to use the proper leaves
for the nest.

203
00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:55.750
The proper leaves?

204
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:57.540
In keeping with tradition,

205
00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:59.919
the ceremonial nest
should be made of the leaves

206
00:08:59.919 --> 00:09:02.709
from the top of the tallest
tree in the land.

207
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:04.670
Seriously?

208
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:07.250
Well, I don't just make up
these traditions.

209
00:09:07.291 --> 00:09:10.501
It makes sense,
the fronds at the top
are the softest.

210
00:09:10.501 --> 00:09:12.169
Fit for a hero.

211
00:09:12.169 --> 00:09:14.619
Exactly, Ono.

212
00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.120
Maybe you do know
what you're talking about.

213
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.330
Oh, uh, I do?

214
00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:20.750
Of course, you do, Ono.

215
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:23.000
And while Ono spends
time with Hadithi,

216
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.119
the rest of us
can go get the
special leaves.

217
00:09:25.119 --> 00:09:26.329
Right, guys?

218
00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:27.500
Uh.

219
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.380
Maybe?
Sure we can!

220
00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:31.540
Just point me
to the tallest tree.

221
00:09:33.999 --> 00:09:36.999
It sure was nice of you to let
Ono stay with Hadithi.

222
00:09:36.999 --> 00:09:39.709
Shouldn't we be doing
more important things

223
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:42.080
than fetching leaves
from the tallest tree?

224
00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.920
For some eagle
we've never heard of?

225
00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.120
(CHUCKLES)
But my Dad's
heard of him.

226
00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.209
Yeah!

227
00:09:48.209 --> 00:09:50.119
And he's Ono's biggest hero!

228
00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.790
Right.
So let's go find
that tallest tree.

229
00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:58.330
The higher you fly,
the more they'll look up
to you.

230
00:09:58.829 --> 00:10:00.669
ALL: Ah.

231
00:10:00.669 --> 00:10:02.209
That's all well
and good for storks,

232
00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:04.500
but elephants don't fly.

233
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.120
I think what Hadithi
is trying to say is,

234
00:10:07.161 --> 00:10:10.621
we all have challenges
that require us to rise
above ourselves.

235
00:10:10.621 --> 00:10:12.539
To become better than we are.

236
00:10:12.539 --> 00:10:14.619
Ah. Thanks, Ono.

237
00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:16.580
Wise words, Hadithi.

238
00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:18.710
Indeed.

239
00:10:18.751 --> 00:10:22.041
KION: Maybe it wasn't
such a good idea
to leave Ono behind.

240
00:10:22.041 --> 00:10:23.379
I got this.

241
00:10:23.379 --> 00:10:24.669
<i>Zuka Zama!</i>

242
00:10:24.669 --> 00:10:26.119
(GRUNTING)

243
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Whoo!

244
00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:33.210
A-ha! Whoa!

245
00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:34.620
You guys should come up.

246
00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.209
I can see everything
from here!

247
00:10:37.209 --> 00:10:39.669
Just get the leaves
and come down!

248
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:42.000
But it's the tallest tree
in the Pride Lands.

249
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.120
I can see Pride Rock.

250
00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.500
I can see Mekundu Cliffs.

251
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.039
I can see the tallest tree
in the Pride Lands.

252
00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.000
Uh-oh.

253
00:10:52.041 --> 00:10:55.161
Did he just say he could
see the tallest tree
in the Pride Lands?

254
00:10:55.161 --> 00:10:56.960
(GROANS) Yep.

255
00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.460
And everyone will
look up to you.

256
00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:01.829
ALL: Ah.

257
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:03.790
Thank you for coming,
everyone.

258
00:11:03.831 --> 00:11:08.421
And don't forget
my Royal Mud Print ceremony
tonight at sundown.

259
00:11:08.421 --> 00:11:09.460
ALL: Hadithi.

260
00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:10.620
Hadithi!

261
00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:11.879
Hadithi!

262
00:11:11.879 --> 00:11:14.289
Everyone! Back off!

263
00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:16.790
Give Hadithi
the respect
he deserves!

264
00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.250
Thank you, Ono.

265
00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.750
It seems you're
a natural, too.

266
00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.079
I am?

267
00:11:24.079 --> 00:11:25.879
Me?

268
00:11:25.921 --> 00:11:30.661
In that case, do you
think you could show me
the Hadithi Spin?

269
00:11:30.661 --> 00:11:34.421
Well, I'd rather not
muss my feathers
so close to the ceremony.

270
00:11:34.421 --> 00:11:37.710
Why don't you show me,
and I'll tell you
if you're doing it right.

271
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:39.709
Uh, okay!

272
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:40.750
Great!

273
00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:47.380
Okay. Here goes.

274
00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.579
Three mid-air loops
and a corkscrew.

275
00:11:49.579 --> 00:11:51.249
Hadithi!

276
00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:52.750
You watching?

277
00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:55.620
I sure am!
Give it all you got.

278
00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:57.750
One.

279
00:11:58.499 --> 00:11:59.619
Two.

280
00:12:00.289 --> 00:12:02.039
Three!

281
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.380
Oof! Ahem!

282
00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:07.290
I, uh...

283
00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:10.920
I think possibly I forgot
to compensate for the wind.

284
00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.749
Well, that's your mistake,

285
00:12:12.749 --> 00:12:14.919
the wind always
compensates for me.

286
00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.500
Oh...

287
00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.000
Never mind.
Try it again.

288
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.790
You'll see, Hadithi,
this time I'll get it!

289
00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:29.750
Almost there, little B.

290
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:30.750
Ah!

291
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:33.210
I got an idea.

292
00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:35.790
How about we put
the ceremonial nest
right here?

293
00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.499
(CHUCKLES) I want
to sit right up front.

294
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.750
Hey, birds only.

295
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:43.000
But we're Hadithi fans too!

296
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.750
It's okay. We'll find
another place to sit.

297
00:12:47.419 --> 00:12:49.669
That was very nice
of you, Mtoto.

298
00:12:49.669 --> 00:12:50.919
I don't mind, Beshte.

299
00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.330
After all, you're still
my number one hero!

300
00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:55.670
Huh.

301
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:57.830
Lot of animals
want to see Hadithi.

302
00:12:57.830 --> 00:12:59.540
Huh. I guess.

303
00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:00.709
So, where is he?

304
00:13:01.209 --> 00:13:02.669
One.

305
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:05.750
Two. Two and a half loops!

306
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:06.920
Almost there!

307
00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.250
What do you think, Hadithi?

308
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:10.750
Hadithi?

309
00:13:11.419 --> 00:13:13.499
Oh! Uh.

310
00:13:13.499 --> 00:13:15.379
Oh. Looked great, Ono.

311
00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.170
You weren't even watching.

312
00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:20.420
I'm sorry, but I have
to look my best!

313
00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.500
It wouldn't do for my fans
to have their hero show up

314
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.829
looking like he just came
in from a windstorm!

315
00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:28.749
Although,
it might make me look
even more heroic.

316
00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:32.420
One more try!
I bet I can do it!

317
00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.460
I doubt that.

318
00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:35.669
Time to go!

319
00:13:35.669 --> 00:13:38.919
What? But you said
I was a natural.

320
00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.460
A natural with the crowd.

321
00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:42.750
You give them what they want.

322
00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:44.420
You play them perfectly.

323
00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:45.620
Play them?

324
00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:47.000
What do you mean?

325
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.749
You always tell them exactly
what they want to hear!

326
00:13:49.749 --> 00:13:50.879
I do?

327
00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.880
But, I'm just being honest.

328
00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.120
Being honest.

329
00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.920
Oh, isn't that interesting.

330
00:14:00.789 --> 00:14:02.039
(GASPS)

331
00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:06.380
Hadithi!

332
00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:07.580
Klipspringers in trouble!

333
00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:08.960
On the rocks just below.

334
00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.210
Klipspringers are
excellent climbers.

335
00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:13.459
They got up there,
I'm sure they can get down.

336
00:14:13.459 --> 00:14:15.289
I suppose.

337
00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:16.880
I guess you guys will be fine.

338
00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.540
(HYENAS LAUGHING)
ONO: (GASPS) Hyenas?

339
00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:21.750
Hadithi!
It's Janja and his clan!

340
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:23.330
They've got
the klipspringers cornered!

341
00:14:24.419 --> 00:14:26.539
A whole hyena clan?

342
00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:28.580
We can take 'em out
with the Hadithi Spin!

343
00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:31.960
Uh. Oh. Uh, I don't think
you're ready for that, Ono.

344
00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.040
And, I wouldn't want
you to get hurt.

345
00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.670
Especially
so close to my ceremony.

346
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:37.379
Speaking of which, come on.

347
00:14:37.379 --> 00:14:38.499
We're going to be late.

348
00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.250
But, the hyenas.

349
00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:42.500
Can't keep my fans waiting.

350
00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:44.750
Hadithi? Why're you leaving?

351
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:47.500
Guess it's up to me.

352
00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.960
Look!
Here he comes!

353
00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.000
(ALL ANIMALS CHEERING)

354
00:15:00.379 --> 00:15:02.419
Welcome, Hadithi.

355
00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:04.580
Thank you, King Simba.

356
00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:05.580
Very soft.

357
00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:07.290
Yes, this will do.

358
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.620
Where's Ono?

359
00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:13.080
He's, uh,
still trying to get
