(KION READING)

5
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.880
So, Scar has returned.

6
00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:10.710
I'm afraid so, Father.

7
00:01:10.711 --> 00:01:13.000
It's my fault,
Grandfather Mufasa.

8
00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:14.080
The Roar...

9
00:01:14.081 --> 00:01:18.000
The Roar has the ability
to do both good and evil.

10
00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:21.000
I know.
But now that Scar is back,

11
00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:22.170
how do we defeat him?

12
00:01:22.171 --> 00:01:25.040
The appearance of an evil lion
from the past

13
00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:28.290
is beyond my experience,
my son.

14
00:01:28.291 --> 00:01:33.170
But you have
saved the Pride Lands
from Scar before.

15
00:01:33.171 --> 00:01:36.290
Trust that the wisdom
to defeat Scar

16
00:01:36.291 --> 00:01:39.040
lies within the Pride Lands,

17
00:01:39.041 --> 00:01:41.670
and within the two of you.

18
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.000
"The wisdom is within
the Pride Lands." Dad?

19
00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:50.920
Do you think Grandfather
means a wise animal?

20
00:01:50.921 --> 00:01:56.120
Perhaps, and if he did,
I know exactly
who we should talk to.

21
00:01:56.121 --> 00:01:58.080
Me? You want me to escort

22
00:01:58.081 --> 00:02:01.170
the wisest animal
in the Pride Lands
to meet with the King?

23
00:02:01.171 --> 00:02:04.790
Yes, yes! It is one
of the duties
of the Royal Mjuzi.

24
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.710
You don't need
to send Makini, Simba.

25
00:02:07.711 --> 00:02:09.080
I can talk to you
right now.

26
00:02:09.081 --> 00:02:11.790
I don't think he's looking
for advice from you, Bunga.

27
00:02:11.791 --> 00:02:13.790
Most definitely not.

28
00:02:13.791 --> 00:02:15.580
Okay, your loss.

29
00:02:15.581 --> 00:02:17.960
Simba seeks counsel
from Kongwe,

30
00:02:17.961 --> 00:02:20.540
the wisest of the wise.
BESHTE: Oh, yeah!

31
00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:23.040
Kongwe's the oldest animal
in the Pride Lands.

32
00:02:23.041 --> 00:02:25.040
Ooh! Do you know
where she is?

33
00:02:25.041 --> 00:02:28.380
Last I heard, she was living
along the rocky bank
of Urembo River,

34
00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:30.170
about a half-a-day's walk
from here.

35
00:02:30.171 --> 00:02:33.580
Half a day? I'd like
to speak to her
as soon as possible.

36
00:02:33.581 --> 00:02:37.000
Maybe a half-day for them,
but I can do it faster.

37
00:02:37.001 --> 00:02:39.040
Excellent.
Thank you, Fuli.

38
00:02:39.041 --> 00:02:42.750
Yes! You shall escort
the escort. (LAUGHS)

39
00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:44.710
I can't wait!
Let's go, Fuli!

40
00:02:44.711 --> 00:02:47.080
I'm so excited
to spend time with you.

41
00:02:47.081 --> 00:02:49.880
I'll learn all about you
and you'll learn all about me.

42
00:02:49.881 --> 00:02:52.170
It's gonna be so great!
Don't you think so, Fuli?

43
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.750
Fuli?

44
00:02:54.751 --> 00:02:56.250
You coming, Makini?

45
00:02:56.251 --> 00:02:58.460
Ooh, yeah! Wait for me.

46
00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.040
Okay, the rest of us
are on patrol.

47
00:03:02.041 --> 00:03:05.710
Whatever Scar has planned
for the Pride Lands,
we need to be ready.

48
00:03:05.711 --> 00:03:08.120
You got it, Kion!
Affirmative.

49
00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.120
MAKINI: My favorite
is definitely
bright pink flamingos.

50
00:03:12.121 --> 00:03:14.120
Oh, but orange
and brown giraffes
are pretty, too.

51
00:03:14.121 --> 00:03:16.290
What animal do you think's
the prettiest, Fuli?

52
00:03:16.291 --> 00:03:18.500
I never really
thought about it.

53
00:03:18.501 --> 00:03:21.120
Oh, blue turacos!
I forgot about them.

54
00:03:21.121 --> 00:03:22.420
I love blue!

55
00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:23.420
(SIGHS IN EXASPERATION)

56
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.250
Okay, here we are.

57
00:03:27.251 --> 00:03:30.500
Urembo River.
Really? We got here fast.

58
00:03:30.501 --> 00:03:32.170
Fast is what I do.

59
00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:36.170
So, let's find Kongwe
and get her back
to the King, quick.

60
00:03:36.171 --> 00:03:37.330
What does she look like?

61
00:03:37.331 --> 00:03:38.960
Ooh, I don't know.

62
00:03:38.961 --> 00:03:41.330
Okay, what kind of animal
is she?

63
00:03:41.331 --> 00:03:42.750
Don't know that, either.

64
00:03:42.751 --> 00:03:44.460
Don't you think
that's something

65
00:03:44.461 --> 00:03:47.210
we might have asked Rafiki
before we left?

66
00:03:47.211 --> 00:03:49.710
Yes, you are so right, Fuli!

67
00:03:49.711 --> 00:03:53.120
That's definitely something
we should have asked Rafiki
before we left.

68
00:03:53.121 --> 00:03:54.880
But at least we know
where to find her.

69
00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:56.210
She should be right here.

70
00:03:56.211 --> 00:04:00.290
Huh, finding her would go
a lot faster if we knew
what she looked like.

71
00:04:00.291 --> 00:04:01.500
Whoa!

72
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.420
Faster is not always better.

73
00:04:06.421 --> 00:04:08.210
Oh, are you Kongwe?

74
00:04:08.211 --> 00:04:09.380
Yes.

75
00:04:09.381 --> 00:04:12.920
Of course, you are.
What you just said
sounded really wise.

76
00:04:12.921 --> 00:04:15.420
But you already know that,
being so wise and all.

77
00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:17.170
And that's why the King
needs to see you.

78
00:04:17.171 --> 00:04:18.120
The King?

79
00:04:18.121 --> 00:04:20.170
Yes, he wants to see you
right away.

80
00:04:20.171 --> 00:04:22.000
I see.

81
00:04:22.001 --> 00:04:24.960
But, of course,
you're a tortoise.

82
00:04:24.961 --> 00:04:28.580
Indeed, for my mother
was a tortoise.

83
00:04:28.581 --> 00:04:33.210
A child of a tortoise
is also a tortoise.

84
00:04:33.211 --> 00:04:37.420
Oh, you are wise.
Isn't she wise, Fuli?

85
00:04:37.421 --> 00:04:38.920
Uh, I guess?

86
00:04:38.921 --> 00:04:41.750
Now, let's go.
We don't want to keep
the King waiting.

87
00:04:41.751 --> 00:04:44.250
Oh, Fuli's right.
We should hurry.

88
00:04:44.251 --> 00:04:48.210
To run is not necessarily
to arrive.

89
00:04:48.211 --> 00:04:51.210
That sounds super-wise!

90
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.170
What exactly does it mean?

91
00:04:53.171 --> 00:04:56.710
It means this is gonna be
a long trip.

92
00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.460
So, Kion, does King Simba
have a plan to defeat Scar?

93
00:05:02.461 --> 00:05:03.710
KION: Not yet.

94
00:05:03.711 --> 00:05:06.290
Hopefully, this Kongwe
will have some good ideas.

95
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.290
Seeing anything
interesting, Ono?

96
00:05:08.291 --> 00:05:09.830
Not really.

97
00:05:09.831 --> 00:05:12.170
Unless you count hyraxes
crossing the bridge

98
00:05:12.171 --> 00:05:13.670
to the watering hole
as interesting.

99
00:05:13.671 --> 00:05:15.040

Oh!

116
00:05:53.081 --> 00:05:54.710
Everyone up there okay, Ono?

117
00:05:54.711 --> 00:05:57.080
(CHATTERING)
Affirmative.

118
00:05:57.081 --> 00:05:59.330
Though we now have
a bunch of thirsty hyraxes

119
00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:00.960
that can't get
to the watering hole.

120
00:06:00.961 --> 00:06:02.710
Sorry, little guys.

121
00:06:02.711 --> 00:06:05.170
Aw, they look so thirsty.

122
00:06:05.171 --> 00:06:08.580
Hey! I can go up there
and throw 'em
across the ravine.

123
00:06:08.581 --> 00:06:11.120
I'm not so sure
that's a good idea, Bunga.

00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:12.120
Hmm...

125

What you thinking, Beshte?

126
00:06:14.171 --> 00:06:16.920
Well, if we could move
one of those big rocks...

127
00:06:16.921 --> 00:06:18.290
KION: It could make
another bridge.

128
00:06:18.291 --> 00:06:20.540
But how would we hold it up?

129
00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:22.460

helping the animals

Okay, if we keep up this pace,

149

I think we can be back at
Pride Rock just after sundown.

Kongwe? You okay?

153
00:07:18.121 --> 00:07:21.670
Kongwe found
an amazing flower. Look.

154
00:07:21.671 --> 00:07:23.540
Another flower?
Yeah!

155
00:07:23.541 --> 00:07:25.790
It's totally different
from the last one.

156
00:07:25.791 --> 00:07:26.880
It's a flower.

157
00:07:26.881 --> 00:07:30.080
(SNIFFS) Each bloom
is unique, Fuli.

158
00:07:30.081 --> 00:07:32.880
You'd see that if you
just stop and observe.

159
00:07:32.881 --> 00:07:35.040
That is so true, Kongwe!

160
00:07:35.041 --> 00:07:37.460
And so wisdom-y!

161
00:07:37.461 --> 00:07:39.960
Okay, but right now we have

162
00:07:39.961 --> 00:07:43.120
slightly more important things
to see than flowers,

163
00:07:43.121 --> 00:07:44.420
like the King!

164
00:07:44.421 --> 00:07:47.080
Oh, that's so true,
too, Fuli.

165
00:07:47.081 --> 00:07:49.380
Aren't you excited
to see the King, Kongwe?

166
00:07:49.381 --> 00:07:52.250
I have seen many things,
young Mjuzi,

167
00:07:52.251 --> 00:07:55.620
because I stop and observe.

168
00:07:55.621 --> 00:07:58.170
That's probably the best way
to see a lot of things.

169
00:07:58.171 --> 00:08:00.580
I see a lot more
when I'm going fast.

170
00:08:00.581 --> 00:08:03.580
Oh, that must be a good way
to see things, too.

171
00:08:03.581 --> 00:08:05.420
Oh, it is!

172
00:08:05.421 --> 00:08:06.790
Trust me.

You have an interesting

198
00:09:43.881 --> 00:09:46.290
I thank you
for sharing it with me.

199
00:09:46.291 --> 00:09:50.000
See? So why don't we
get moving again?

200
00:09:50.001 --> 00:09:52.620
Yes, soon.

201
00:09:52.621 --> 00:09:55.540
You've given me so much
to ponder now.

202
00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:58.000
Seriously?

203
00:09:58.001 --> 00:10:00.790
Any sign of Fuli
and Kongwe, Ono?

204
00:10:00.791 --> 00:10:02.290
No sign of them.

205
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:05.880
ONO: (GASPS) Hapana!
A wildfire!

206
00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.170
Over at the Poromoko Crevasse!

207
00:10:08.171 --> 00:10:10.330
And it looks like the eland
are trapped!

208
00:10:10.331 --> 00:10:14.290
Till the Pride Lands end...
ALL: Lion Guard defend!

209
00:10:14.291 --> 00:10:18.380
Hello? Hello? Kongwe?

210
00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:20.120
Maybe she's not home.

211
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.750
Kongwe?
I'm thinking.

212
00:10:23.751 --> 00:10:25.830
(SIGHS) Can't you think
and walk?

213
00:10:25.831 --> 00:10:29.920
He who chases two hares
will catch neither.

214
00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:33.670
Fine, stay in your shell.
We still have to get you
to the King.

216
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:38.170
A little help?

217
00:10:38.171 --> 00:10:39.330
Oh, of course!

218
00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.880
Ooh, shwari.

219
00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:48.250
(GRUNTING)
Almost!

220
00:10:48.251 --> 00:10:49.250
Argh!

221
00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.920
Again? Oh.

222
00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:56.920
(BOTH GRUNTING)

223
00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:03.710
Uh-oh.

224
00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.420
Uh, Kongwe, you okay?

225
00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.380
Kongwe?

226
00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:15.830
Have you ever noticed clouds?

227
00:11:15.831 --> 00:11:18.500
And the way
they follow the wind?

228
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.040
Even upside-down,
you're wise.

229
00:11:21.041 --> 00:11:23.500
She certainly sounds okay.

230
00:11:23.501 --> 00:11:27.120
Now, we just gotta
figure out a way
to flip her back over.

231
00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:33.250
Oh.

232
00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:36.790
What are you waiting for?
We need to see the King.

233
00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.210
MAKINI: At least we're going
faster now, right, Fuli?

234
00:11:41.211 --> 00:11:44.170
I think it was faster
when we were pushing her.

235
00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:45.620
Hmm.

236
00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.080
Would you look at this?

237
00:11:48.081 --> 00:11:49.920
Do we have to?

238
00:11:49.921 --> 00:11:53.580
One doesn't usually see
roots like this close-up.
I sure haven't.

239
00:11:53.581 --> 00:11:55.500
I wonder why these roots
aren't in the ground.

240
00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:00.120
And I wonder
why they're moving.

241
00:12:00.121 --> 00:12:02.000
FULI: Because that tree's
about to fall!

242
00:12:02.001 --> 00:12:03.080
Move!

243
00:12:03.081 --> 00:12:04.380
(FULI GRUNTS)
(MAKINI SCREAMS)

244
00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:08.580
That was some fast save, Fuli.

245
00:12:08.581 --> 00:12:11.830
Hey, maybe fast is best.

246
00:12:11.831 --> 00:12:14.750
That's what I keep saying.
KONGWE: Perhaps.

247
00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.330
Kongwe?

248
00:12:16.331 --> 00:12:21.120
But sometimes,
standing still is
the fastest route to safety.

249
00:12:21.121 --> 00:12:22.210
You got lucky.

250
00:12:22.211 --> 00:12:24.330
Not luck, observation.

251
00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.040
But also, I did get lucky.

252
00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:33.290
When a big tree falls,
many eat its leaves.

253
00:12:33.291 --> 00:12:35.170
Or many get crushed.

254
00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:38.250
If I hadn't gotten you
to stop and look at the tree,

255
00:12:38.251 --> 00:12:40.500
perhaps we all would have
been crushed.

256
00:12:40.501 --> 00:12:41.670
Maybe.

257
00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:44.000
This tree is
not going anywhere,

258
00:12:44.001 --> 00:12:47.040
and neither are we,
at least not on this path.

259
00:12:47.041 --> 00:12:48.620
We could go over!

260
00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:51.460
Oh, but Kongwe can't.

261
00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.330
So, here's what
we're gonna do.

262
00:12:57.331 --> 00:13:00.170
There's a path back there
that cuts through
the Backlands.

263
00:13:00.171 --> 00:13:02.330
That's the fastest way
to get to Pride Rock
from here.

264
00:13:02.331 --> 00:13:03.830
Come on.

265
00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:06.710
The Backlands
are leopard territory,

266
00:13:06.711 --> 00:13:08.080
so stay close to me.

267
00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.120
Unless one is a bird,

268
00:13:10.121 --> 00:13:13.830
one rarely gets to see
the top of a tree this close.

269
00:13:13.831 --> 00:13:15.080
Seriously?

270
00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.920
We're going the right way,
but keep an eye out.

271
00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:22.540
I always keep an eye out.

272
00:13:22.541 --> 00:13:25.210
Well, there is a lot to see
here in the Backlands.

273
00:13:25.211 --> 00:13:26.790
I should come here
more often.

274
00:13:26.791 --> 00:13:28.380
You're always welcome.

275
00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:31.040
Especially you, tortoise.

276
00:13:31.041 --> 00:13:33.120
That's very friendly
of you! I'm...

278
00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:38.040
You're a real delicacy
around here, tortoise.

279
00:13:38.041 --> 00:13:40.210
Back off, Makucha.
They're with me.

280
00:13:40.211 --> 00:13:42.830
(CHUCKLES) Oh.
Didn't see you there, cheetah.

281
00:13:42.831 --> 00:13:44.040
Well, now you have.

282
00:13:44.041 --> 00:13:48.080
And now I wanna see
you walking away.

283
00:13:48.081 --> 00:13:50.830
So, where are
your Lion Guard pals?

284
00:13:50.831 --> 00:13:54.040
Don't you worry about them.
You deal with me.

285
00:13:54.041 --> 00:13:58.250
Okay, cheetah,
I'll be on my way...
For now.

286
00:13:58.251 --> 00:14:01.540
But remember,
you're in my territory.

287
00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:05.620
Not for long.
Let's keep moving.

288
00:14:05.621 --> 00:14:08.210
Wow, Fuli, that was amazing!

289
00:14:08.211 --> 00:14:11.040
You were amazing! I've never
seen anything like that.

290
00:14:11.041 --> 00:14:13.000
Have you ever seen
anything like that, Kongwe?

291
00:14:13.001 --> 00:14:15.000
I've seen many things.

292
00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.620
He's gone for now,
but I bet he comes back.

293
00:14:18.621 --> 00:14:20.880
So we really need
to pick up the pace.

294
00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:26.170
This way!

295
00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.210
Where are they?
I don't see 'em.

296
00:14:29.211 --> 00:14:30.790
They were right here, Kion.

297
00:14:30.791 --> 00:14:32.290
They must be lost
in the smoke.

you're with me.

guide us from the sky.

00:14:40.121 --> 00:14:41.000
Affirmative.

303
00:14:45.001 --> 00:14:47.080
The fires are limited to
the trees at the top
of the canyon!

304
00:14:47.081 --> 00:14:49.330
It's not spreading
any further.

305
00:14:49.331 --> 00:14:50.380

We're not

Uh, actually, Kion,
we are.

still a threat.

311
00:15:05.961 --> 00:15:08.920

to get everyone
into the canyon.

312
00:15:08.921 --> 00:15:12.000

The canyon's a natural break
against the fire.

Kion!
We're okay, but we're cut off.

317

Ono, any other way down?
Or across?

318
00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:33.290
I don't think so.
The canyon narrows up ahead.

319
00:15:33.291 --> 00:15:35.330
But it's too far
for the elands to jump.

320
00:15:35.331 --> 00:15:38.960
Maybe they can't jump it,
but if we could cross it...

a bridge right about now.

Just what I was thinking.
One Big B bridge coming up.

I won't miss my supper.

349
00:16:52.961 --> 00:16:54.920
I thought I told you
to back off.

350
00:16:54.921 --> 00:16:57.670
(CHUCKLING) What can I say?

351
00:16:57.671 --> 00:17:01.210
I just couldn't get the taste
of tortoise off my mind.

352
00:17:01.211 --> 00:17:02.540
(SNARLS)

353
00:17:02.541 --> 00:17:04.290
(BOTH SNARLING)

354
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:08.380
(GRUNTS)
Whoa!

355
00:17:08.381 --> 00:17:10.580
Come down here
so I can make you leave.

356
00:17:10.581 --> 00:17:12.250
Why don't you come up here
and get me?

357
00:17:12.251 --> 00:17:16.080
Oh, right.
Cheetahs can't climb trees.

358
00:17:16.081 --> 00:17:17.330
Argh!

359
00:17:17.331 --> 00:17:19.380
(GRUNTING)

360
00:17:19.381 --> 00:17:21.210
See you, cheetah.

361
00:17:21.211 --> 00:17:22.880
(GROWLS)

362
00:17:22.881 --> 00:17:24.330
(GRUNTS)

363
00:17:24.331 --> 00:17:26.670
(GASPS)
(SNARLING)

364
00:17:26.671 --> 00:17:28.040
Oh, no, you don't!

365
00:17:28.041 --> 00:17:30.080
(GRUNTS) Come on, claws!

366
00:17:30.081 --> 00:17:32.210
(LAUGHS)

367
00:17:32.211 --> 00:17:34.960
You're all mine, tortoise.

368
00:17:34.961 --> 00:17:36.960
(KARATE GRUNTS)

369
00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.960
(KARATE GRUNTS CONTINUE)

370
00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:44.170
I learned this move
from Rafiki.

371
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:47.830
Maybe I should have learned
some other moves.

372
00:17:47.831 --> 00:17:51.620
You're just lucky I never
really liked mandrill.

373
00:17:51.621 --> 00:17:53.120
You don't like me?

374
00:17:53.121 --> 00:17:54.210
(FULI GRUNTS)

375
00:17:54.211 --> 00:17:56.040
(BOTH SNARL)

376
00:17:56.041 --> 00:17:57.920
(MAKUCHA LAUGHING)

377
00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.960
(PANTING)

378
00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.710
Give it up, Makucha.
You can't outrun me.

379
00:18:09.711 --> 00:18:12.000
(LAUGHS) We'll see about that.

380
00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:14.040
(GRUNTS)

381
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.460
(LAUGHS) You may be fast,
cheetah, but can you do this?

382
00:18:20.461 --> 00:18:22.250
(LAUGHS)

383
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.750
(LAUGHTER ECHOING)
(PANTING) I'll stop you.

384
00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:28.710
Somehow.

385
00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:34.250
You chased him off!
Big deal, he'll be back.

386
00:18:34.251 --> 00:18:36.790
Unless I can figure out
a way to beat him.

387
00:18:36.791 --> 00:18:41.170
To beat the leopard,
you must observe the leopard.

388
00:18:41.171 --> 00:18:43.250
I have observed him!

389
00:18:43.251 --> 00:18:47.040
I observe him zigzagging
away from me every time.

390
00:18:47.041 --> 00:18:50.960
I observe him making me
run a lot more than he does.

391
00:18:50.961 --> 00:18:54.790
Cheetah, cheetah,
always running.

392
00:18:54.791 --> 00:18:58.670
You must relax and observe.

393
00:18:58.671 --> 00:19:01.750
Relax?
Of course!

394
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Shwari, Fuli!

395
00:19:04.001 --> 00:19:06.000
Just take a breath
and slow down.

396
00:19:06.001 --> 00:19:08.920
But...
It really works.

397
00:19:08.921 --> 00:19:12.210
Fine. (BREATHES DEEPLY)

398
00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:17.000
Now, Fuli,
what have you observed?

399
00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:21.000
He always zigzags,
but I can't.

400
00:19:21.001 --> 00:19:26.170
I see. So, he always zigzags.

401
00:19:26.171 --> 00:19:27.380
Yes, he...

402
00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:29.380
Always.

403
00:19:29.381 --> 00:19:32.790
(GASPS) Hmm.
Okay, I got this.

404
00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.500
Hey, Makucha.
Ready for round two?

405
00:19:36.501 --> 00:19:40.250
More like round three or four.
But who's counting?

406
00:19:40.251 --> 00:19:41.830
Catch me if you can.

407
00:19:41.831 --> 00:19:43.330
Hint, you can't.

408
00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:46.080
(PANTING)

409
00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:50.080
Observe.

410
00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:54.420
(PANTING) Always.

411
00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:01.250
(GRUNTS)

412
00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:03.920
You... You caught me?

413
00:20:03.921 --> 00:20:07.120
I'll always catch you,
so back off.

414
00:20:07.121 --> 00:20:10.290
Or next time,
I'll do more than tackle you.

415
00:20:10.291 --> 00:20:13.960
You know what?
I've lost my taste
for tortoise.

416
00:20:13.961 --> 00:20:15.040
That's good.

417
00:20:15.041 --> 00:20:19.080
But I haven't lost my taste
for leopard.

418
00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:23.170
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY
AND CLEARS THROAT)

419
00:20:23.171 --> 00:20:24.580
(PANTING)

420
00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:29.080
You did it!
(CHUCKLES)

421
00:20:29.081 --> 00:20:32.500
I guess I did.
All it took was
a little observing.

422
00:20:32.501 --> 00:20:35.420
The cheetah listened
to the tortoise.

423
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:40.000
Perhaps now,
I've truly seen everything.

424
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:44.920
MAKINI: It sure is nice
to be back in the Pride Lands!

425
00:20:44.921 --> 00:20:46.210
Back in the Pride Lands?

426
00:20:46.211 --> 00:20:47.960
It's a long story.

427
00:20:47.961 --> 00:20:51.330
Well, wait till
you hear about Beshte.
He was a bridge!

428
00:20:51.331 --> 00:20:54.460
Hmm. I'd like
to have seen that.

429
00:20:54.461 --> 00:20:56.920
You must be Kongwe.
I'm Kion.

430
00:20:56.921 --> 00:20:58.920
Let's get you to my dad.
Come on.

431
00:20:58.921 --> 00:21:03.920
Hmm. Hurry, hurry
brings no blessings.

432
00:21:03.921 --> 00:21:06.830
I think that means she's
going as fast as she can.

433
00:21:06.831 --> 00:21:10.040
Guess you were surprised
Kongwe turned out to be
a tortoise.

434
00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:11.710
Fuli?

435
00:21:11.711 --> 00:21:15.710
Have you ever
stopped to notice how
the clouds never rush?

436
00:21:15.711 --> 00:21:18.170
They just follow the wind.

437
00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:24.580
Hmm. So Scar has returned.

438
00:21:24.581 --> 00:21:26.960
It is indeed
a difficult problem.

439
00:21:26.961 --> 00:21:28.790
Uh, yeah!

440
00:21:28.791 --> 00:21:30.040
Bunga!

441
00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:33.080
So, Kongwe,
what do we do?

442
00:21:33.081 --> 00:21:38.000
Fortunately, it is
the patient animal
who eats the ripe fruit.

443
00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:40.790
Yes.
Uh-huh.

444
00:21:40.791 --> 00:21:42.210
FULI: Oh!

445
00:21:42.211 --> 00:21:45.380
I think she means we'll
find the solution eventually.

446
00:21:45.381 --> 00:21:47.710
But we need to take
the time to look.

447
00:21:47.711 --> 00:21:49.120
I see.
Oh!

448
00:21:49.121 --> 00:21:50.620
Very wise.

449
00:21:50.621 --> 00:21:54.250
Yes, yes, cheetah!
I have seen many things.

450
00:21:54.251 --> 00:21:58.750
And good always triumphs
over evil, in time.

451
00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:03.460
