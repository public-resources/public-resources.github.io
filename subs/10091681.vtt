Why're you causing
so much trouble?
What trouble?

54
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.540
You shook the baboons
out of their tree.

they were shouting about...

that so many trees

know it's there.

No reason or anything.
He just flew away.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.290

That's why rhinos
partner with tickbirds.

ride on the rhinos

Oh, my other right!

179
00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.250
Why didn't you say so?

180
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.750
(GROANS) This is going
to be a long trip.

181
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.210

00:07:47.119 --> 00:07:48.249
(GROANS)

183
00:07:49.119 --> 00:07:50.669
Everything okay, Ono?

184
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:54.710
Fine. Fine.
Everything's fine.
Just keep walking.

185
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.080
Okey-dokey.

186
00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.170
(CONTINUES GRUNTING
AND SNORTING)

187
00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.670
Okay. We want
to take the path
to the right.

188
00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:08.750
Righty-o.

189
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:12.830
No, the other right.
The other right.

190
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:14.499
It's this way!

191
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.120
Okay, okay.
You don't have
to shout.

192
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.620
Mwenzi never shouted.

193
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.120
Until... (SNIFFLES)

194
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.209
Until he decided
to leave.

(GRUNTS)

198
00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.620
Ow!

199
00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.000
Ono? I have an itch.

200
00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:35.959
Okay...

201
00:08:35.959 --> 00:08:39.999
When rhinos have itches,
their tickbirds scratch them.

202
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.580
Mwenzi did it for me
all the time.

203
00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.790
I see. Okay.
Where's the itch?

204
00:08:47.329 --> 00:08:48.829
Inside my ear.

205
00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:50.379
Of course it is.

206
00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.380
(GRUNTING)

207
00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.210
There you go.

208
00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:55.880
Now...
You didn't get it.

00:09:00.879 --> 00:09:03.169
Wait, now down
just a little...

212
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:06.620
Okay. Why don't
we get going
to Lake Matope now?

213
00:09:06.661 --> 00:09:10.461
But Mwenzi wouldn't
stop scratching
till I told him to stop.

214
00:09:10.461 --> 00:09:13.919
Kifaru, I'm not Mwenzi.

215
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.580
No. No, you're not...

Excuse me.

218
00:09:23.919 --> 00:09:27.499
I hope the guard
finds Mwenzi soon.

219
00:09:27.541 --> 00:09:31.921
Ono, I may not see very well,
but my hearing is perfect.

220
00:09:31.921 --> 00:09:35.040
And Mwenzi would never mutter
under his breath!

221
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.459
(SIGHS) Sorry.

You have.

We're just going around

to get a good scent!

228
00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.830
Hey, I think Mwenzi's
been here!

229
00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:57.750
(SNIFFS) Yeah.

230
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:59.289
Pretty recently too.

231
00:09:59.289 --> 00:10:01.499
Maybe he's still here!
I'll check it out!

00:10:10.749 --> 00:10:12.039
I didn't see it!

There!

239
00:10:13.329 --> 00:10:14.419
I saw a red beak!

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:16.290
Big B, you know Mwenzi.

241
00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:18.290
Is that him?
I'm not sure.

242
00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:20.210
He flew by so fast.

243
00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:21.670
Mwenzi!

244
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:23.579
I don't know
if that's not Mwenzi,

245
00:10:23.579 --> 00:10:25.289
or he's just ignoring me.

246
00:10:25.289 --> 00:10:26.499
I have an idea.

247
00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:33.871

a lonely little rhino
covered with ticks!

If only I had
a tickbird
to help me out!

249
00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:43.330
Don't worry,
little rhino!
I'll help you!

250
00:10:43.371 --> 00:10:46.291
Hey! I don't have
any ticks back here!
What gives?

251
00:10:46.291 --> 00:10:48.039
Hey, there, Mwenzi!
Beshte?

252
00:10:48.039 --> 00:10:51.169
But you're not a rhino!
Ha!

But you're just the tickbird
we've been looking for!

What do you
want with me?

256
00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:00.919
Sorry we tricked you, Mwenzi.

257
00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.460
But it was the only way
to get you to stop
and talk to us.

258
00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:06.960
Talk about what?
Uh, Kifaru.

259
00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.250
Oh. Him.
What about him?

260
00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:12.880
Well, without you,
he's causing
all sorts of damage.

261
00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.499
He really needs
his tickbird.

262
00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:15.920
You have
to come back to him.

263
00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.790
After what he did?
No way!

264
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:18.960
What'd he do?

265
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.460
He said you just flew off
for no reason.

266
00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:23.750
No reason?
No reason?

267
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:26.459
Is that what he said?
No reason?

268
00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.420
So you're saying
there was a reason?

269
00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:30.960
Uh, yeah!

270
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.170
We were running late
for Tamasha,
and he blamed me!

271
00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:35.789
We're always late.

272
00:11:35.789 --> 00:11:38.539
It's always Kifaru's fault!

273
00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.620
But he always blames me!

274
00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:42.670
So what would you do?

275
00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:45.460
(SCOFFS) I'd leave
and I wouldn't look back.

276

(COUGHS)

277
00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:50.039
But, uh, that doesn't mean
it's what you should do.

278
00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.120
Yeah, Mwenzi.

279
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.580
You and Kifaru were
such good friends.

280
00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.880
He seems pretty lost
without you.

281
00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.880
And not just because
he can't see!

282
00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.420
Though he really
can't see!

283
00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:03.039
Doesn't seem like
you're doing so great either.

284
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.460
Looked like you were
just flying around aimlessly.

285
00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:08.210
Well, uh, I am used
to having a job to do.

286
00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:10.330
Looking after Kifaru, right?

287
00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:11.619
Yeah.

288
00:12:11.619 --> 00:12:14.039
Just come with us
and talk to him.

289
00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.830
Real friends work things out.

290
00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:17.710
You really think
he misses me?

291
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:19.080
Of course he does.

292
00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.620
Look how much time
you spent together.

293
00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:21.670
How could he not?

294
00:12:22.209 --> 00:12:23.959
(SIGHS) Okay.

295
00:12:23.959 --> 00:12:26.039
I guess it wouldn't hurt
to talk to him.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:34.960
What are these?

300
00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.329
Jackalberry leaves.

301
00:12:36.329 --> 00:12:37.829
You asked for them.

302
00:12:37.829 --> 00:12:39.959
I had to fly halfway across
the savannah to...

303
00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.710
But I like the dark green
jackalberry leaves.

304
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:44.460
How am I supposed
to know that?

305
00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:46.040
Well, Mwenzi knows.

306
00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.419
I'm not Mwenzi!

307
00:12:50.039 --> 00:12:52.419
Hmm, you know, Ono...

308
00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:54.880
I should actually
thank you.
You think so?

309
00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.080
Yes.

310
00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.790
If you weren't so bad
at being a tickbird,

311
00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:02.789
I'd never know how wonderful
Mwenzi really was.

312
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:04.710
Well, you're welcome.

313
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:05.880
Wait, what?

(PANTING)

315
00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.330
Ah! Kifaru!
What's wrong?

316
00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:13.750
All this walking's
got me overheated.

317
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:17.579
Oh! Uh, well, the lake's
not too much farther...

318
00:13:17.621 --> 00:13:21.751
Mwenzi'd always
make sure I was near mud
to cool off.

319
00:13:23.379 --> 00:13:25.879
Maybe I can dig
for some mud.

320
00:13:25.879 --> 00:13:28.499
Huh. Here.
Let me help.

321
00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:33.620
Oh! Oh, this is nice!

322
00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.710
Mwenzi's so much
smaller than you.

323
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:37.999
He could never
do something
like this for me.

324
00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.960
(SCOFFS) Did you just say
I was better at something
than Mwenzi?

325
00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.290
Oh, yeah.

326
00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:46.880

couldn't do this
if he tried.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:51.790
Ono's the best?

329
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:54.250
I thought you said Kifaru
was lost without me?

330
00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:56.250
But he was!
You should have
seen him...

331
00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:59.500
I do see him! And I see
that he's doing just fine!

332
00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.419
Well, if that's
what he wants...

333

Huh? Mwenzi?

334
00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:05.460
Mwenzi! You came back!

335
00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:09.000
Only to say this.
Goodbye forever!

looks like you'll have to be
my tickbird from now on.

It's not safe to
leave him alone!

take care of him!

that tickbird back!
