He's got more enemies
than friends.

109

Kion, you don't have summits
just to talk to your friends.

110

You have summits
to help turn conflict
into friendship.

To build trust.

00:08:12.249 --> 00:08:13.709
He's down
by the watering hole.

177
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:15.710
And he sounds really mad!

178
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:17.790
This is exactly what
I was worried about!

179
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:18.750
Come on!

180
00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:21.710
Wait for me!

181
00:08:23.039 --> 00:08:24.619
Bupu.

182
00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.790
All we crocodiles do
during the dry season
is sleep.

183
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:30.120
Right! You'll pretend
to be sleeping,

184
00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.710
so we'll let down
our guard.

185
00:08:31.751 --> 00:08:36.121
Isn't this summit
supposed to be about
negotiating in good faith?

186
00:08:36.121 --> 00:08:38.539
Good faith?
With a croc?

187
00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:41.710
(SCOFFS) Next you'll tell me
the dry season's wet.

188
00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:42.750
What?

189
00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:44.330
I know all
about you crocodiles

190
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.420
and your "crocodile way."

191
00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.619
Well, no thanks!
(GRUNTS)

192
00:08:48.619 --> 00:08:50.379
Why you...

193
00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.620
(GROWLING)

194
00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:53.960
KION: That's enough,
Makuu!

195
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:56.380
Beshte.

196
00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:57.670
On it, Kion.

197
00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.959
Why don't you both
take a deep breath

198
00:08:59.959 --> 00:09:01.709
before you say something,

199
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:04.000
or eat something
you'll regret?

200
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.420
I was trying
to talk to him.

201
00:09:06.461 --> 00:09:09.961
But it seems there's no point
talking to a jumpy antelope.

202
00:09:09.961 --> 00:09:11.789
You've got that right!
(GROANS)

203
00:09:11.789 --> 00:09:12.879
(GROWLS)

204
00:09:12.879 --> 00:09:14.749
Makuu!
I'm warning you.

205
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:17.580
I won't let anyone ruin
the Savannah Summit.

206
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:18.960
Especially you.

207
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.830
Especially me?

208
00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:21.830
(SIGHS)

209
00:09:22.499 --> 00:09:24.169
Fine.

210
00:09:24.169 --> 00:09:26.879
I don't want any trouble.

211
00:09:26.921 --> 00:09:30.331
He'll think twice
before tangling
with an antelope.

212
00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:32.790
That was close.

213
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:33.710
Oh, yeah!

214
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:35.999
Simba would be pretty upset
if his summit ended

215
00:09:35.999 --> 00:09:38.079
with Makuu eating
Bupu for lunch.

216
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.620
Good thing we got here
when we did.

217
00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.250
Yeah.
Thanks, Mtoto.

218
00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:44.250
Huh? Oh, sure.
Glad to help.

219
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.790
Hey, Mtoto.

220
00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:47.329
You think you could
keep your ears open

221
00:09:47.329 --> 00:09:48.669
for the rest
of the summit?

222
00:09:48.669 --> 00:09:50.709
Let us know if you hear
anything suspicious?

223
00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:51.880
Yes, sir!

224
00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.460
I'm pretty sure
Makuu's up to something.

225
00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:57.210
So we need to be ready
for any sign of trouble.

226
00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:58.290
All of us.

227
00:10:00.499 --> 00:10:02.379
Gotta listen.
Gotta listen.

228
00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.500
Listen for any sign
of trouble...

229
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:09.960
TWIGA: (MUFFLED)
<i>Vuruga Vuruga, Makuu...</i>

230
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.919
That sounds
like trouble to me!

231
00:10:12.919 --> 00:10:16.249
Wait! What exactly
did Twiga say about Makuu?

232
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:17.460
I'm not sure!

233
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:18.880
It couldn't have
been good!

234
00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.080
Everyone knows crocs
and giraffes don't mix!

235
00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.750
(GASPS) I'll bet
Makuu's going to
attack Twiga!

236
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:25.289
And ruin the summit.

237
00:10:25.289 --> 00:10:27.919
I bet that's what
Makuu's been planning
all along!

238
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.750
'Til the Pride Lands' end...

239
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:31.620
ALL: Lion Guard defend!

240
00:10:36.169 --> 00:10:37.619
Back off, Makuu!

241
00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:40.880
"Makuu?"

242
00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.290
Don't worry, Twiga,
I'll protect ya'.

243
00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:44.380
From what?

244
00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:45.920
From Makuu!

245
00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.959
Where is he?
No Makuu here.

246
00:10:47.959 --> 00:10:49.619
But Mtoto heard him!

247
00:10:49.619 --> 00:10:51.249
Uh, well, no.

248
00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:53.790
I heard Twiga
talking about Makuu.

249
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:56.380
Me? I wasn't talking
about Makuu.

250
00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.620
Were you talking
about Makuu?

251
00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.290
No, why would I
talk about Makuu?

252
00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:00.579
How should I know?

253
00:11:00.579 --> 00:11:02.539
I'm just eating branches.

254
00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.330
Like a giraffe does.

255
00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:07.880
Me, too.
Delicious branches.

256
00:11:10.499 --> 00:11:12.709
Uh, Vuruga Vuruga?

257
00:11:12.709 --> 00:11:14.329
Aren't you more
of a grass eater?

258
00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:15.670
(SWALLOWS)

259
00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:18.170
Buffalo eat
whatever we want.

260
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:19.880
Uh, okay.

261
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.830
So, Twiga,
you're all right?

262
00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:23.169
Oh, yes. Fine.

263
00:11:23.169 --> 00:11:25.119
Totally fine.
Thanks for asking.

264
00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.920
Now, I'm sure there are
more important matters at the
summit for you to attend to.

265
00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.420
Yeah. Let's go.

266
00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:35.790
That was strange,
right?

267
00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:37.499
We did interrupt
their lunch.

268
00:11:37.499 --> 00:11:39.579
I don't think
it was that, Little B.

269
00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:41.210
They seemed
real nervous.

270
00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:43.420
Especially any time
we mentioned Makuu.

271
00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:46.040
Hmm. What if
he threatened them,

272
00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.169
and they're too
afraid to tell us?

273
00:11:48.169 --> 00:11:49.289
To tell us?

274
00:11:49.289 --> 00:11:50.959
But we're the Lion Guard.

275
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.040
That's how much
he must've scared them.

276
00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.420
Just having Makuu here
is hurting the summit.

277
00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.920
Good thing Mtoto can hear
if anything bad's happening.

278
00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.919
Yeah! I wish I could
hear like you, Mtoto.

279
00:12:00.919 --> 00:12:03.329
It'd be
un-Bunga-lievable!

280
00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:04.830
I'll do my best.

281
00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:07.210
ZAZU: (SQUAWKING) <i>Help!</i>

282
00:12:07.251 --> 00:12:10.001
Hey! I'm getting
the hang of this!
I just heard...

283
00:12:10.001 --> 00:12:11.379
Zazu!
Yeah, but...

284
00:12:11.379 --> 00:12:12.709
We all heard him.

285
00:12:12.709 --> 00:12:13.879
This way.

286
00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:16.170
(RAFIKI LAUGHING)

287
00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:18.120
Mbeya,
you must get up!

288
00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:21.540
I cannot finish the portrait
with you sitting down.

289
00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.330
KION: Where's Zazu?
Is he in trouble?

290
00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:24.919
(GASPS)
Did Makuu eat him?

291
00:12:24.919 --> 00:12:28.789
(LAUGHS) Perhaps,
Zazu himself can explain.

292
00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:29.960
Eh, Zazu?

293
00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:31.880
ZAZU: Not funny,
Rafiki!

294
00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.500
At least, you're
right about that.

295
00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.620
I'm not getting off
until you apologize, Zazu.

296
00:12:37.249 --> 00:12:39.919
ZAZU: Apologize? Me?

297
00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.540
I'm the one with
a rhinoceros on his head.

298
00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.710
You think this is what
the King meant

299
00:12:44.751 --> 00:12:46.871
when he asked us to look out
for trouble at the summit?

300
00:12:46.871 --> 00:12:48.079
Not exactly.

301
00:12:48.079 --> 00:12:50.079
He called me clumsy.

302
00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.120
No, he didn't.
I did.

303
00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.750
Uh, Rafiki?

304
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:54.960
(LAUGHING)

305
00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.710
No, no, Kion.

306
00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:01.000
It is the Lion Guard
that must get to the...

307
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.749
(LAUGHING)

308
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:05.170
...bottom of the situation.

309
00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:08.540
(LAUGHING)
"Bottom!" I get it.

310
00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:11.250
(SIGHS) Will someone
just tell me
what happened?

311
00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:13.329
I was having
a perfectly nice time

312
00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:17.210
when suddenly this...
This hippo with a horn
bumps into me.

313
00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:18.960
Who are you
calling a hippo?

314
00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.750
I'm a rhino,
you baboon!

315
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:22.170
Who are you
calling a baboon?

316
00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:24.039
You are a baboon.

317
00:13:24.039 --> 00:13:25.789
Oh. Right.

318
00:13:25.789 --> 00:13:27.579
ZAZU: (MUFFLED) What does
it matter what happened?

319
00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:29.500
Just get off of me.

(GASPING)

321
00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.580
Daylight!

322
00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.580
(SIGHS) I thought
I'd never see you again!

323
00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:40.040
Hey, Mbeya, looks like
you have some hornbill
stuck on your backside!

324
00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.960
Come on, everyone.

325
00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:43.120
It was just an accident.

326
00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.500
You're right.
Sorry, Mbeya.

327
00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.830
Uh... That's okay.

328
00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:49.919
Sorry I sat on you,

329
00:13:49.919 --> 00:13:53.079
(GRUNTING)
Quite all right.

330
00:13:53.121 --> 00:13:57.251
Rafiki, please tell me
this won't make it into
the official portrait.

331
00:13:57.251 --> 00:14:01.080
(LAUGHING)
Not the official one.

332
00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.499
Lion Guard, Lion Guard!
It's Makuu!

333
00:14:03.541 --> 00:14:06.081
MAKUU: (MUFFLED)
<i>All right, Bupu,
I've heard enough!</i>

334
00:14:06.081 --> 00:14:07.790
I think
he's at Pride Rock!

335
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:09.420
And he's yelling
at Bupu again!

336
00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:10.710
Let's go!

337
00:14:11.619 --> 00:14:13.119
That's right, Bupu!

341
00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:19.250
Dad? We heard...

(GRUNTS)

343
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:23.040
You heard us
negotiating, cub!

344
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.879
We were just about
to reach an agreement

345
00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:29.040
for the crocodiles to
sleep by the antelopes'
watering hole.

346
00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:32.710
Now, Bupu, Makuu,
if we can just...
Forget it!

347
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:35.670
How can I trust any of you
if you don't trust me?

348
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:37.999
This whole summit's
a joke!

349
00:14:37.999 --> 00:14:40.669
But Makuu,
we were so close.

350
00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:44.960
Don't worry, Bupu.
We can try again.

00:14:45.001 --> 00:14:48.211
With all due respect,
your highness,
I don't see the point.

I've done my best.

353
00:14:49.789 --> 00:14:53.329

not the crocodile way.

But there's something
going on!

358
00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:04.080
I'm not sure what,
but Makuu...

359
00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.210
Is a new leader.

360
00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:08.210
I need to
build his trust.

361
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:10.540
That's why I included
him in the summit.

362
00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:12.379
But he just
wants to ruin it!

363
00:15:12.379 --> 00:15:14.079
You may have
ruined it.

364
00:15:14.329 --> 00:15:15.789

365
00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:16.960
I'm sorry, Dad.

366
00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.830
Then find a way
to fix it.

367
00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:20.540
I have to get back
to Mizimu Grove

368
00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:23.210

of the summit.

so upset about?

You saved him.

373
00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.790
No, I didn't.

374
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:37.119

didn't need saving.

going on with Makuu?

378

My Dad is really
upset with me.

382
00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:01.329
And I'm worried that
I ruined his summit.

383
00:16:01.329 --> 00:16:04.209
I didn't mean to.
It's just...

384
00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:07.080
I was so sure Makuu
wanted to ruin it.

385
00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:10.250
And what has Makuu done
to make you think this?

386
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:11.880
Well, he...

387
00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.079
He...

388
00:16:13.079 --> 00:16:14.879
Nothing really.

389
00:16:14.921 --> 00:16:18.331
But I've got this feeling
that something bad's
going to happen.

stopping Makuu. Right?

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.420
(CHUCKLES)
Excuse me, son.

527
00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:36.960
I need to get
a handle on this

528
00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.579
before it gets
out of control.

529
00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:41.920
MTOTO'S MOM:
(MUFFLED) <i>Mtoto.</i>

530
00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.750
Mom! I forgot.

531
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:45.670
I'm on my way home
right now!

532
00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:46.710
Bye, everybody!

533
00:21:48.539 --> 00:21:51.499
Ya know, I'm glad
I can't hear like Mtoto.

534
00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:53.420
I don't want to know
everybody's business!

535
00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:55.040
Just as well.

536
00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:58.580
You'd look pretty silly
with ears that big.

537
00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.170
(ALL LAUGHING)

538
00:22:01.419 --> 00:22:03.419
(CHORUS VOCALIZING)

539
00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:28.379
<i>♪ Look out
Here comes the Lion Guard ♪</i>
