00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:11.579
Everyone, everyone!

6
00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:13.379
What's the ker-bubble, Ono?

7
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.920
There's trouble
with the zebras!

8
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.710
Oh, what else is new?

9
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.250
And the gazelles!

10
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.710
The zebras and the gazelles
are in trouble?

11
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.959
No, they are the trouble!
They're fighting each other!

12
00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:26.039
Zebras and gazelles
don't fight.

13
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.710
You seein' okay, Ono?
Look. How many fingers?

14
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.170
I know what I saw!

15
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.040
If the zebras and gazelles
really are fighting,

16
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.379
we better check it out.

17
00:01:34.379 --> 00:01:38.209
Till the Pride Lands end...
ALL: Lion Guard defend!

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.330

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.210
(GRUNTING)

20
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.500
So weird.

21
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.419
I've never seen zebras
and gazelles act like this.

22
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.540
Hey, wait. I know these herds!

23
00:01:50.581 --> 00:01:55.501
Those zebras follow Muhimu.
And the gazelles follow Swala.

24
00:01:55.501 --> 00:01:58.380
But Muhimu and
Swala are friends!

25
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.919
Something's not right. Ono!

26
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.250
Can you see Muhimu and Swala?

27
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.080
Affirmative!

28
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.540
ONO: Looks like they're
in the middle of everything.

29
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.880
Then that's where
we're going! Come on!

30
00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:14.209
Let's move, zebra-deebras!

31
00:02:14.251 --> 00:02:18.961
Black with white stripes on
one side. White with black
stipes on the other!

32
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.040
'Scuse me, guys.
I think I can handle this.

<i>Twende kiboko!</i>

34
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:26.670
Whoa!

35
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.210
Thanks, Beshte.

36
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.380
Uh-oh!

37
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.790
Wha...

38
00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:35.539
Uh, hello?

39
00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:37.919
Ew. That's gotta hurt.

40
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.170
(LAUGHS)

41
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.210
Nice move, Muhimu!

42
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.250
What do you mean, nice move?
You pushed me!

43
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.670
So? What are you
going to do about it?

44
00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:49.119
(GRUNTING)

45
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.920
I know whose side I'm on.

46
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.120
I heard that!

47
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.330
Muhimu! Swala! Stop! Hey...

48
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.830
Enough!
(GROWLING)

49
00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.379
(GASPING)

50
00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:01.249
What's going on?
Swala, Muhimu.

51
00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.250
I thought you two
were friends!

52
00:03:03.291 --> 00:03:07.461
We were, until Swala and
the gazelles tried to steal
our grazing grounds!

53
00:03:07.461 --> 00:03:12.211
Your grazing grounds? Muhimu,
these are our grazing grounds!

54
00:03:12.211 --> 00:03:14.789
Ha, no, they're ours!

55
00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.880
But this is the Pride Lands.
Can't you just share?

56
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:21.331
Beshte's right. These grazing
grounds are for everyone.

57
00:03:21.331 --> 00:03:24.169
There's plenty of grass
for zebras and gazelles.

58
00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:25.499
ONO: Um, Kion...

59
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.380
That's not exactly true...

60
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.380
Except for where you are,
I only see dirt!

61
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.960
There's no other
grass at all?

62
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.290
Seriously?

63
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.420
Wait. So you zebras and
gazelles aren't really
mad at each other.

64
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.670
You're just hungry!

65
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.290
I do get cranky
when I'm hungry.

66
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.290
And now you see
why we're hungry.

67
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.330
There's not enough grass!

68
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.960
Well, then we just need
to find a place with enough
grass for all of you.

69
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.120
Can you do that?

70
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.710
Yes, where is all this grass?

71
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.790
I don't know...
But I know who will!

72
00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.169
Hmm. I knew the herds
were large this year,

73
00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.540
but I didn't realize
they'd outgrown
their grazing grounds.

74
00:04:02.541 --> 00:04:06.421
Isn't there somewhere
with enough grass for
the herds to share?

75
00:04:06.421 --> 00:04:09.040
Kion, you see that
patch of green,

76
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.079
far out in the distance?

77
00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:12.789
Mbali Fields?

78
00:04:12.831 --> 00:04:17.461
Mbali Fields. That's where
the zebras and gazelles
can find their grass.

79
00:04:17.461 --> 00:04:22.251
But that's at the very edge
of the Pride Lands. You think
they can make it?

80
00:04:22.251 --> 00:04:26.460
I'm certain they can.
Because I'm sending the
Lion Guard with them.

81
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.250
You want me to
lead a migration?

82
00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:32.581
You'll have the rest
of the Guard with you.
But I know you, Kion.

83
00:04:32.581 --> 00:04:35.500
You can do whatever
you put your mind to.

84
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.919
Thanks, Dad.
I won't let you down.

85
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.250
You never do.

86
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:40.830
(NEIGHING)

87
00:04:42.751 --> 00:04:48.001
Who's ready for a Savannah
trip? Raise your hooves! Whoo!

88
00:04:48.001 --> 00:04:49.379
Oh. It's you.

89
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.960
Have we met?

90
00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.790
Uh, yeah. You sat on me
yesterday? Remember?

91
00:04:55.831 --> 00:04:59.661
I don't have the slightest
idea what you're talking
about, little mongoose.

92
00:04:59.661 --> 00:05:02.579
Mongoose? I'm a honey badger!

93
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.000
Whatever.

94
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.880
When are we getting
this show on the road?

95
00:05:05.921 --> 00:05:10.251
I need to get to the grazing
grounds. Before it is time.

96
00:05:10.251 --> 00:05:11.829
"It is time"?

97
00:05:11.829 --> 00:05:14.249
Don't get all Rafiki
on me, Muhimu.

98
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.460
We're almost ready to go.
Just keep your stripes on.

99
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.710
Looks like everyone's
ready, Kion.

100
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.999
Great. Did you scout
us the best route?
Affirmative.

101
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.330
Through the plains
past Maji Baridi Falls,

102
00:05:27.371 --> 00:05:31.001
down Rocky Ridge, then
right through the canyon
to Mbali Fields.

103
00:05:31.001 --> 00:05:32.380
Pretty simple, really.

104
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.380
I was hoping you'd say that.

105
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.749
Listen up, everybody!

106
00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:38.289
It's a long way
to Mbali Fields.

107
00:05:38.331 --> 00:05:41.711
But I'll do my best to get
you all there safe and sound!

108
00:05:41.711 --> 00:05:43.290
We know you will!

109
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.040
We trust you, Kion!
Right, everyone?

110
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.539

So far so good.

130
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.380
Though it seems like
everyone's slowing down.

131
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.580
I'd better give 'em
some encouragement.

132
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.750
Hey, everyone!
I know you're tired and
I know you're hungry but...

133
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.710
We were hungry
when we started!

134
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.620
Now we're starving!

135
00:07:17.661 --> 00:07:23.161
It's not much farther,
I promise. We'll get
to Mbali Fields soon!

136
00:07:23.161 --> 00:07:25.879
We will get to Mbali
Fields soon, right?

137
00:07:25.921 --> 00:07:30.371
Affirmative. We just have
to go down this steep slope
and through the canyon.

138
00:07:30.371 --> 00:07:32.250
You can see the Fields
from here.

139
00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:36.040
I just hope we get there
before the storm hits.

140
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.750
We're almost there, everyone!
See the patch of green at
the end of the canyon?

141
00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:42.210
Look at all that grass.

142
00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:45.750
I can almost taste
it from here. Oh, yummy!

143
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:49.669
Yummy? You know it's gonna
taste like grass, right?

144
00:07:49.711 --> 00:07:55.251
(ENTHUSIASTICALLY)
Yes! I can't wait.
In fact, I can't wait!

Whoa! Muhimu?

146
00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:01.579
Out of my way!
I'm coming, grass! I'm coming!

147
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.420
Great idea!
Let's go eat!

148
00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.460
Uh-oh.
(HOOVES THUNDERING)

149
00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:10.620

Let's run!

we gotta stop them!

154
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:21.880
Meet you at the
front of the herd.

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:40.880
I'm on it!

159
00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:45.500
Everyone, stop!

160
00:08:48.379 --> 00:08:50.579
KION: Back! Run back, now!
(CONFUSED BRAYING)

161

(GROANING)
Why did you shove me?

162
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:04.080
Don't you know
I'm in a family way?

163
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.080
No, you were in
the rocks' way!

164
00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.000
I was trying to
save your life!

165
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.620
Oh. Well, that's different.

166
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:13.749
Now, could you please get up?
You're sitting on me!

167
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:16.540
Well, now you know
how it feels!

168
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.620
What's that supposed to mean?

169
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.620
Oh, never mind.
Odd little hedgehog.

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.959

172
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.080
Guess we're not as
close as we thought.

What do we do now, Kion?

174
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:32.750
Well, the herds
can't go over it.

175
00:09:32.791 --> 00:09:36.921
And we can't go through it.
So we've got to go around it.

176
00:09:36.921 --> 00:09:39.829
Ono. Scout out another route
to the grazing grounds.

177
00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:41.960
I'm on it.

178
00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.620
I blame the zebras for this.

179
00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:52.750
Oh, no.

180
00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:55.710
Any luck?

181
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:58.960
Well, I did find another
route to the grazing grounds.

182
00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.209
That's great!

183
00:10:00.209 --> 00:10:02.039
But it goes through
the Outlands.

184
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.250
That's not so great.

185
00:10:04.291 --> 00:10:07.421
I promised my dad we'd get
these herds to their new home.

186
00:10:07.421 --> 00:10:09.880
And if we have to go through
the Outlands to get there,

187
00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.879
then that's what
we're going to do.

188
00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.420
At least we've got one thing
going for us. That storm
hasn't started yet.

189
00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:16.540
(THUNDER CLAP)

190
00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.750
Maybe I shouldn't have
said that out loud.

191
00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:30.210
I'm starting to wonder if Kion
knows what he's doing.

192
00:10:30.251 --> 00:10:35.041
He says we're almost there,
now he's taking us in a
different direction!

193
00:10:35.041 --> 00:10:37.579
Has he ever even
led a migration?

194
00:10:37.579 --> 00:10:39.669
Maybe we should've
stayed home.

195
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:42.670
If Simba had brought us,
we'd be there by now.

196
00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:45.250
I'm not sure Kion can
handle a trip like this.

197
00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:46.670
(GROANS)

198
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:47.709
Is it just me

199
00:10:47.709 --> 00:10:50.459
or is this water
getting deeper?

200
00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.080
(GASPING)
Oh, no. Kion, look out!

201
00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.459
Flash flood!

202
00:11:00.459 --> 00:11:02.249
(SCREAMING)

203
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.710
Higher ground, everyone! Move!

204
00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:06.880
(SCREAMING)

205
00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:12.749
No animal gets lost! Let's go!

206
00:11:12.749 --> 00:11:15.459
Ono, keep these animals
on safer ground!

207
00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:16.920
We'll get the others!

208
00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.750
You got it!

209
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:22.830
Zebras! Gazelles!
This way! Uphill!

210
00:11:23.879 --> 00:11:25.749
BOTH: Help! Help me!

211
00:11:25.749 --> 00:11:27.119
I'm coming, zebras!

212
00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:30.000
(GRUNTING)

213
00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.920
Help! Help!

(GROANS)

216
00:11:49.829 --> 00:11:51.619
Not gonna lose you, gazelle.

217
00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:53.830
Oof!

218
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.960
(PANTING)
Thank you, Fuli.

219
00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.249
Kion!

220
00:11:59.249 --> 00:12:01.829
Don't panic, Swala!
I'll get you!

221
00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:02.959
Here we go!

222
00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.000
Whoa!

223
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.830
(GRUNTING)

224
00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:09.250

(GRUNTING)

226
00:12:11.619 --> 00:12:13.499
Help! Help me!

227
00:12:13.499 --> 00:12:15.579
Muhimu! I'm coming!

228
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.040
<i>Zuka Zama!</i>

229
00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:20.710
Gotcha, Muhimu!

230
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:23.880
You've got me?
You're the size of my head!

231
00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.829
Then it's a good thing
you've got a big head!

232
00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:27.209
(GRUNTING)

233
00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:30.920
Muhimu, work with me here!

234
00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.830
I'm trying, but it's hard!
I'm swimming for two!

235
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:39.160
I'm the one swimming for two!
Now help me out and paddle!

236
00:12:44.251 --> 00:12:49.251
Well, now that you've
saved me twice, I suppose
I should admit it.

237
00:12:49.251 --> 00:12:50.999
I did sit on you.

238
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.460
Yeah! I've still got the
stripe marks to prove it.

239
00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:58.460
Anyway, I'm sorry.
And, thank you.

240
00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:02.750
<i>Hakuna matata.
</i> Come on. We have to
get to higher ground.

241
00:13:06.501 --> 00:13:09.291
ZEBRA #2: And who takes the
low ground during a rainstorm?

242
00:13:09.291 --> 00:13:13.421
Yes, he saved me, but it's
his fault I was in trouble in
the first place, right?

243
00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:23.790
(CLEARS THROAT)
So, um, Kion, what now?

244
00:13:25.289 --> 00:13:26.959
Kion?

245
00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.210
I don't know.

246
00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:31.750
Keep an eye on the herds.
I'll be back.

247
00:13:37.329 --> 00:13:41.079
Kion, something's
troubling you.

248
00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:44.080
Grandfather, I don't
know what to do.

249
00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.170
Dad trusted me to
lead the herds.

250
00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:48.670
But everything went wrong.

251
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:52.079
And now they all think
I'm a bad leader.

252
00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.500
And I think they
might be right.

253
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:59.080
Kion, don't let their lack
of faith affect yours.

254
00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.959
I really do want them
to trust me.

255
00:14:01.959 --> 00:14:06.959
They will. As long
as you trust yourself.

256
00:14:07.001 --> 00:14:12.161
Confidence, Kion.
That's all you need to
complete this journey.

257
00:14:12.161 --> 00:14:16.160
But confidence doesn't
come from what others
think about you.

258
00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.830
It comes from inside yourself.

259
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.880
Thank you, Grandfather.

260
00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:31.040
You think Kion's
gonna be okay?

261
00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.040
Sure he is! He's Kion!

262
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.960
KION: Hey, guys!

263
00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:38.579
The herds have been talking,
and we're not happy.

264
00:14:38.621 --> 00:14:43.041
You promised us the trip would
end in a huge field with
enough grass for everyone.

265
00:14:43.041 --> 00:14:46.461
We're not there yet.
It's taking longer
than we thought.

266
00:14:46.461 --> 00:14:49.249
But I know we'll make it.
Trust me.

267
00:14:49.249 --> 00:14:50.829
I'm not sure I do.

268
00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:53.460
Me, neither!
I'm with Swala!

269
00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:54.960
Well, I trust Kion!

270
00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.620
So do I!

271
00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:59.380
I agree. The trip hasn't gone
the way we hoped.

272
00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:01.749
But it's not Kion's fault!

273
00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:04.460
Part of it was mine.

274
00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.170
We all know I started
the stampede.

275
00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:10.170
If I hadn't, we wouldn't have
had to change course.

276
00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:13.330
And who can predict
a flash flood?

277
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:17.750
But Kion and the Lion
Guard got us through
it safe and sound.

278
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.170
I have faith in you, Kion.

279
00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:24.620
And, and I promise to make
things easier from now on,

280
00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:25.919
not harder.

281
00:15:25.919 --> 00:15:27.289
Thanks, Muhimu.

282
00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:32.210
There's a whole new life
for you at Mbali Fields.

283
00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:34.580
Now we have to cut
through the Outlands.

284
00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:37.919
I won't lie. There
are predators there.

285
00:15:37.919 --> 00:15:39.709
But you're with
the Lion Guard,

286
00:15:39.751 --> 00:15:45.161
and we'll keep you safe.
That's a promise!
We will keep you safe!

287
00:15:45.161 --> 00:15:46.540
So, who's ready?

288
00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:48.209
I am.
Me too.

289
00:15:48.209 --> 00:15:49.789
Let's do it.

290
00:15:49.789 --> 00:15:51.919
(CHEERING)

291
00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.790
You'll keep me safe, right?

292
00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:56.250
'Course I will!
What are friends for?

293
00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:57.750
We're friends?

294
00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:01.040
Sure! As long as you promise
not to sit on me again.

295
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.919
This way, everyone!

296
00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:11.580
Remember, everybody.
We're in the Outlands now.

297
00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:14.329
Be as quiet as
you can. Got it?

298
00:16:14.329 --> 00:16:15.789
(LOUDLY) But what if...
(HUSHING)

299
00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:18.120
Shh! Kion said to be...
(SCREAMING)

300
00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:20.040
It's time!

301
00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.670
Yeah! Time to stay quiet!

302
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:26.209
No! Time for the baby!

303
00:16:26.209 --> 00:16:27.749
What baby?

304
00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:30.620
The baby I'm about to have!

305
00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:34.670
Baby? You're having a baby?
Like a baby baby?

306
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:35.999
Like a baby, baby, baby?

307
00:16:37.169 --> 00:16:38.709
Why didn't you tell me?

308
00:16:38.751 --> 00:16:41.211
I've been telling you the
whole time, you silly
honey badger.

309
00:16:41.211 --> 00:16:44.540
Yes! I'm a honey badg...

310
00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:47.170
(YELLING)
You're having a baby!

311
00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:48.539
(GASPING)

312
00:16:48.539 --> 00:16:50.579
Now who's not being quiet?

313
00:16:50.579 --> 00:16:53.209
You're having a baby?
Right now?

314
00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.330
What do we do?

315
00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:59.170
How should I know?
I only know about eggs.

316
00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:03.040
Leave it to us. She'll need
help, ladies. Who's with me?

317
00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:07.170
She'll want some privacy.

318
00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:09.170
Uh, no problems.
See you later!

319
00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:10.210
MUHIMU: Wait!

320
00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:13.710
Actually, I'll feel safer
if you're nearby.

321
00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:15.959
You saved me before.

322
00:17:16.001 --> 00:17:19.081
I wouldn't be here to
have this baby if it
weren't for you.

323
00:17:19.081 --> 00:17:21.040
Really? Okay!

324
00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:25.380
Um... How "nearby"
do I have to be?

325
00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:29.289
Uh-oh! Here we go!

326
00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:32.580
Not too nearby, then. Good.

327
00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:37.120
A baby zebra?
It's gonna be so cute!

328
00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:42.290
But we're in the Outlands.
There's predators everywhere!
She can't have the baby here!

329
00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.540
She can and she is!

330
00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:49.120
Then we're gonna have to
stay here till she's had it.

331
00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:53.329
No. Fuli's right. There's
a lot of predators out here.

332
00:17:53.371 --> 00:17:56.621
If we want to keep everyone
safe, we need to split up.

333
00:17:56.621 --> 00:17:59.880
You three take the herds to
the new grazing grounds.

334
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.119
I'll stay here with
Bunga and Muhimu.

335
00:18:02.119 --> 00:18:05.289
No! What if there's an attack?
You'll need our help!

336
00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:08.580
What I need is to protect
the Circle of Life.

337
00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:12.120
That means taking care of
this baby and the herds.

338
00:18:13.169 --> 00:18:16.249
Fuli. You know it's
the right thing to do.

339
00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:18.790
(SCOFFS)
Doesn't mean
I have to like it.

340
00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:20.210
Wouldn't expect you to.

341
00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:22.000
See you at the
grazing grounds.

342
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.580
FULI: Come on, everyone.

343
00:18:26.169 --> 00:18:28.379
Um, how you doin' Muhimu?

344
00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:31.330
Muhimu? Everything okay?

345
00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:33.500
(HIGH-PITCHED NEIGH)

346
00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:35.500
Hey, that's pretty good!

347
00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:38.419
You made your voice
sound just like a...

348
00:18:38.419 --> 00:18:42.329
A baby! Your baby! It's here!

349
00:18:47.459 --> 00:18:49.999
Oh, it's a boy.

350
00:18:49.999 --> 00:18:51.329
BOTH: Whoa.

351
00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:52.750
Wow. Look at that.

352
00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:55.330
He's pretty cute.

353
00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:56.460
Does he do anything?

354
00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:58.040
Like what?

355
00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:01.120
I dunno. Like play?
Or tell jokes?

356
00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.329
(NEIGHING)

357
00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:08.790
Ha! Did you hear that?

358
00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:11.960
Yeah. Sounded like a snack!

359
00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:16.079
A whole pack of snacks!
A snack pack!

360
00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.380
(CHUCKLING)

361
00:19:17.421 --> 00:19:21.831
That's not all, Janja. Kion
and Bunga are down there, too!

362
00:19:21.831 --> 00:19:25.661
So what? When we run in,
they're gonna protect
the baby.

363
00:19:25.661 --> 00:19:30.290
But the big zebras
and the gazelle are
gonna panic and run.

364
00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:31.830
Oh yeah!

365
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:34.960
(LAUGHING)
Zebras always do that!

366
00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.960
And then we can pick 'em off
without even thinkin'!

367
00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:42.329
Without thinking? Good!
That's how we do everything!

368
00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:44.460
(LAUGHING)

369
00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:47.250
That was really cool,
but a little loud.

370
00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:50.750
Not your fault, you're weren't
born yet when Kion told
us to be quiet, but...

371
00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:52.919
JANJA: Okay, zebras!
Better run!

372
00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.580
'Cause here we come!

373
00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:57.040
Hyenas!

374
00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:58.290
(SCREAMS)

375
00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:00.880
Panic and run! Panic and run!

376
00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:04.830
No! That's just what
they want! We have to
stick together!

377
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:07.750
Circle around Muhimu
and the baby! Now!

378
00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:11.420
Everyone! Stop running
and listen to Kion!

379
00:20:13.789 --> 00:20:14.789
Thanks.

380
00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:17.540
Now circle up!

381
00:20:21.711 --> 00:20:25.921
What's the matter, zebras?
Not gonna run?
Don't we scare you?

382
00:20:25.921 --> 00:20:30.749
Whoo!
Oogie boogie boogie!
(LAUGHING)

383
00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:34.290
Forget it, Janja. We're not
making it easy for you.

384
00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:36.330
You'll have to
deal with all of us.

385
00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:38.169
Our pleasure.

386
00:20:38.169 --> 00:20:39.709
(GROWLING)

387
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:41.540
BUNGA: <i>Zuka zama!</i>

388
00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:43.250
(GRUNTING)
(BRAYING)

389
00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:45.710
Janja, time for you to g...

390
00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:47.330
(GROWLING)

391
00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:55.420
(BRAYING)
Hmm?

392
00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.330
Ooh!
(YELLING)

393
00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:58.330
Oof!

394
00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:00.460
(GROWLING)

395
00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:01.749
Beat it, Janja!

396
00:21:01.749 --> 00:21:05.039
JANJA: Yeah, yeah.
I don't even like
zebra, anyway!

397
00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.120
CHUNGU: Yeah, it's too chewy!

398
00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.750
CHEEZI: Yeah,
and too... Stripy!

399
00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:10.880
Hey!

400
00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:14.500
Bunga, did you see him?
He kicked that hyena!

401
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.329
He saved my life!

402
00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:18.120
I don't know much
about babies,

403
00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:21.040
but that's a pretty cool
kid you've got there.

404
00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.080
(BRAYING)

405
00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:31.750
All present and accounted for!

406
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:35.460
The Mbali Fields migration
is officially over!

407
00:21:36.459 --> 00:21:38.329
Nothing went the way
we thought it would,

408
00:21:38.329 --> 00:21:40.669
but we still got
everyone here safe.

409
00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:42.330
And that's what counts.

410
00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:43.670
We even added one.

411
00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:45.580
(BRAYING)

412
00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:47.500
Welcome to the Circle of Life.
