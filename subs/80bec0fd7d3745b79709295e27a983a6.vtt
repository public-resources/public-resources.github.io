00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.000
How did they
get here

9
00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:26.330
without us
knowing?

10
00:01:26.331 --> 00:01:28.170
Ullu,
what happened?

11
00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:29.830
I dozed off.
Sorry.

It's the fourth day
in a row

you know
what to do.

Nice moves,

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.960
That's right.

Actually, I think
Bunga is right.

47
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.790
This battle proved
you can be calm,

48
00:02:35.791 --> 00:02:36.920
and focused.

49
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.250

Feels great
being healed,
doesn't it?

53
00:02:44.461 --> 00:02:46.670
And now that
you're healed,
we can go home.

54
00:02:46.671 --> 00:02:48.120
Back to the Pride Lands.

55
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.210
Does this mean
you're leaving?

56
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.580
Right now?

57
00:02:51.581 --> 00:02:52.670
No.

58
00:02:52.671 --> 00:02:53.880
We agreed
to help patrol

60
00:02:55.211 --> 00:02:56.460
So right now,

61
00:02:56.461 --> 00:02:57.540
that's what
we'll do.

62
00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.210
Thank you, Kion.

00:03:01.291 --> 00:03:02.580
time for us
to rest.

65
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.120
So, now that
you're all better,

66
00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:08.670
you can use
the Roar again, right?

67
00:03:08.671 --> 00:03:09.710
Not yet.

68
00:03:09.711 --> 00:03:11.170
Right.
So now we...

69
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:12.170
Say what?

70
00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.380
Fuli, I need you
to take charge today.

71

There's something
I need to do.

Not yet.
What do you mean
not yet?

73
00:03:19.171 --> 00:03:20.290
You're healed.

74
00:03:20.291 --> 00:03:22.040

Let's go.

78
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.080
Yeah. Okay.

79
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.750

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.420
Greetings, Kion.

82
00:03:42.421 --> 00:03:44.210
I'd like to
continue
my training.

83
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.500
Of course.

84
00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.460
You've already made
great progress.

85
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.290
But remember.

86
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.330
Only one who is willing

87
00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:54.580
to let go of
the Roar completely

88
00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:56.500
can truly master it.

89
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.210
I understand,

90
00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.540
and I'm willing
to let the Roar go.

91
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.000
I know
I don't need it

92
00:04:02.001 --> 00:04:03.120
to lead
the Lion Guard.

93
00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.620
Very well.

94
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.380
Soon, Kion,

95
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.420
you will learn
everything

96
00:04:08.421 --> 00:04:10.040

can do.

get it.

99
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.000
What's up
with Kion?

100
00:04:17.001 --> 00:04:19.080
Why doesn't he want
to use the Roar yet?

101
00:04:19.081 --> 00:04:20.790
(GRUNTS)
And where does he go?

(SIGHS)

103
00:04:22.121 --> 00:04:23.460
I don't know, Bunga.

104
00:04:23.461 --> 00:04:24.710
Maybe to the Valley

105
00:04:24.711 --> 00:04:25.920
of None of
our Business,

106
00:04:25.921 --> 00:04:27.620

Those sound like
nice places.

108
00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:30.380
Indeed.

109
00:04:30.381 --> 00:04:31.420
Yep.

110
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.120
Come on,
you can do it.

111
00:04:34.121 --> 00:04:35.960

Hey!

114
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.290
He spit on me.

115
00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.170
Actually,
camel's don't spit.

116
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.290
It's more like
they throw up a little.

117
00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.710
Just when they're worried.

118
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.120
Oh! Hmm.

119
00:04:51.121 --> 00:04:52.170
You okay now, Camel?

See ya, camelly-amel!

122
00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:56.880
And why did Kion say

123
00:04:56.881 --> 00:04:58.540
he's not ready
to use the Roar?

124
00:04:58.541 --> 00:04:59.540
What's that about?

125
00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.540
Bunga, I don't know.

126
00:05:01.541 --> 00:05:02.880
But I trust Kion

127
00:05:02.881 --> 00:05:04.170
to know when he's ready.

128
00:05:04.171 --> 00:05:06.040
Can you keep your mind
on our patrol?

129
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.080
But what if
Kion's in trouble

130
00:05:08.081 --> 00:05:09.460
and he's afraid
to tell us.

131
00:05:09.461 --> 00:05:10.920
I'm sure Kion
would tell us

132
00:05:10.921 --> 00:05:12.040
if he was in trouble.

133
00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:14.420
Maybe. Maybe not.

134
00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.500
You know what?
I want answers.

135
00:05:16.501 --> 00:05:18.210
I'm gonna ask Rani.

136
00:05:18.211 --> 00:05:19.210
Maybe she knows.

137
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.330
Want me to
bring him back?

138
00:05:21.331 --> 00:05:23.330
Nah, let's continue
the patrol.

139
00:05:23.331 --> 00:05:25.040
And enjoy
the peace and quiet.

140
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.080
That last attack
was a disaster.

141
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.460
Is it me or
is the Lion Guard
getting better?

142
00:05:31.461 --> 00:05:32.920
It's Kion.

143
00:05:32.921 --> 00:05:34.830
He's even tougher
than he used to be.

144
00:05:34.831 --> 00:05:36.710
Nothing gets
past him now.

145
00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:37.790
Yes.

146
00:05:37.791 --> 00:05:40.250
And the others
follow his every order.

147
00:05:40.251 --> 00:05:41.790
I don't know
about you two,

148
00:05:41.791 --> 00:05:43.330
but I'm almost ready
to give up.

149
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:44.620
MAMA BINTURONG: Give up.

150
00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.000
Mama Binturong
never gives up,

151
00:05:48.001 --> 00:05:49.250
and neither do you.

152
00:05:49.251 --> 00:05:50.710
(SCOFFS) We don't?

153
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
I do...

154
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.620
Sometimes.

155
00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.670
Don't you worry.

156
00:05:56.671 --> 00:05:58.620
Things are going
to be different

157
00:05:58.621 --> 00:05:59.830
from now on.

158
00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.170
Oh, yeah. How come?

159
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.750
Because we've got
reinforcements.

160
00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:07.330
Mama!

161
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.580
One porcupine?

162
00:06:09.581 --> 00:06:11.170
Yeah, that should
even the odds.

163
00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.620
Smun?

164
00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.290
You did find
the others,
like I asked?

165
00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.170
Oh, yes, Mama.

166
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.920
Still not impressed.

167
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.250
Wait for it.

168
00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:27.040
Hello, Makucha.

169
00:06:27.041 --> 00:06:29.170
Long time no see.

170
00:06:29.171 --> 00:06:32.080
Oh, yeah.
Now we're talking.

171
00:06:32.081 --> 00:06:33.290
Yes.

172
00:06:33.291 --> 00:06:36.920
Soon you'll be dining
on rare animals.

173
00:06:36.921 --> 00:06:39.120
I'll have my revenge.

174
00:06:39.121 --> 00:06:42.880
And that Tree of Life
will be ours.

175
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.040
BUNGA: Hello?

176
00:06:45.041 --> 00:06:47.290
Rani, you down there?

177
00:06:47.291 --> 00:06:48.830
Anybody home?

178
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.670
Bunga, shh!

179
00:06:50.671 --> 00:06:52.080
Be quiet.

180
00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.880
Queen Rani
is resting

181
00:06:53.881 --> 00:06:55.170
and she needs
her rest.

182
00:06:55.171 --> 00:06:56.250
If you keep talking,

183
00:06:56.251 --> 00:06:57.710
you might
wake her up.

184
00:06:57.711 --> 00:06:59.580
So please don't
wake her up.
I you just...

185
00:06:59.581 --> 00:07:01.210
RANI: Makini.
(GASPS)

186
00:07:01.211 --> 00:07:03.250
(SIGHS) It's okay.

Kion was healed.

working on the Roar.

553
00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.710
(ROARS)

554
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:23.500
So, where'd you
send 'em, Kion?

555
00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.170
Far, far away.

556
00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:26.750
Everyone all right?

557
00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.000
Totally fine.

558
00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:31.040
Just sorry we didn't get
to see more of Kion's Roar.

559
00:21:31.041 --> 00:21:33.040
I was right.
I knew it.

560
00:21:33.041 --> 00:21:34.830
You were working
on your Roar.

561
00:21:34.831 --> 00:21:36.920
Now you really
are healed.

562
00:21:36.921 --> 00:21:38.000
Yeah.

563
00:21:38.001 --> 00:21:39.710
I don't know
what to say, Kion.

564
00:21:39.711 --> 00:21:41.460
Thanks for getting
rid of them?

565
00:21:41.461 --> 00:21:43.120
It was the least
I could do.

566
00:21:43.121 --> 00:21:44.250
After all,

567
00:21:44.251 --> 00:21:45.750
I was the one
who led them here.

568
00:21:45.751 --> 00:21:48.580
Now I know
why Queen Janna
was so happy

569
00:21:48.581 --> 00:21:50.420
to have the Roar return
to the Tree of Life.

570
00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.250
And now that's it here...

571
00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:54.250
You should stick around.

572
00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:56.040
Oh.
