(KION READING)

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.170
HIPPO 1:
We were here first.

6
00:01:08.171 --> 00:01:09.290
HIPPO 2:
No, we were.

7
00:01:09.291 --> 00:01:11.670
KION:
Everyone please, stay calm.

8
00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:14.920
You all get water but you need
to wait your turn.

9
00:01:14.921 --> 00:01:18.620
But what if there's nothing
left by the time we get
our turn?

10
00:01:18.621 --> 00:01:20.210
I've never seen the water
this low.

11
00:01:20.211 --> 00:01:22.250
What will we do
when it runs out?

12
00:01:22.251 --> 00:01:23.380
What will we do?

13
00:01:23.381 --> 00:01:25.120
We all need water.

14
00:01:25.121 --> 00:01:27.000
I... I don't know.

15
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:29.580
But don't worry, I'm sure
the King has a plan.

16
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.210
SIMBA:
Surely, I'm not the first
King of the Pride Lands

17
00:01:33.211 --> 00:01:34.880
to face a water shortage,
Rafiki?

18
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.170
Did any of the earlier kings
find a solution?

19
00:01:38.171 --> 00:01:43.250
If they did, the paintings
of the past do not have
many clues.

20
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.580
SIMBA: Interesting. I'm not
familiar with that watering
hole.

21
00:01:47.581 --> 00:01:48.880
Do you know where it is?

22
00:01:48.881 --> 00:01:51.710
Well, I do know it is not
in the Pride Lands.

23
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.460
Ooh, I've seen a watering hole
that looks like that.

24
00:01:54.461 --> 00:01:55.580
You have?

25
00:01:55.581 --> 00:01:57.170
I saw it in the Back Lands.

26
00:01:57.171 --> 00:01:59.830
It's a big watering hole
with lots of water.

27
00:01:59.831 --> 00:02:02.250
It was part of the zebra
herds' grazing grounds.

28
00:02:02.251 --> 00:02:05.290
Zebras? That must be
Dahabu's herd.

29
00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:09.040
I didn't realize there was
such a large watering hole
on her land.

30
00:02:09.041 --> 00:02:10.460
That's our answer.

31
00:02:10.461 --> 00:02:12.170
I knew my dad would have
a plan.

32
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.960
So you want us to take over
their watering hole for
the Pride Lands.

33
00:02:15.961 --> 00:02:17.170
You got it, bro.

34
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.710
Uh, I mean, King Bro?

35
00:02:20.711 --> 00:02:23.120
No, Bunga, that is not
what I want.

36
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.750
Kion, I want you to talk
to the zebra leader, Dhahabu.

37
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.080
Ask her if she'd be willing
to share her watering hole
with us.

38
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.670
Oh, I guess that can work too.

39
00:02:32.671 --> 00:02:34.420
Do you think she'll say yes?

40
00:02:34.421 --> 00:02:36.330
It is a big request.

41
00:02:36.331 --> 00:02:39.830
Ask her if there's anything
we can give them in return.

42
00:02:39.831 --> 00:02:41.460
We need that water, Kion.

43
00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:42.540
And we need it soon.

44
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.000
Don't worry, Dad,
we won't let you down.

45
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.250
Be alert, guys.

46
00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:50.710
This part of the Back Lands
is leopard territory.

47
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.920
Leopards, schmepards.

48
00:02:52.921 --> 00:02:54.830
We can handle 'em,
bring 'em on.

49
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.290
(ROARS)

50
00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.040
Makucha!

51
00:02:58.041 --> 00:02:59.330
Wow, that was fast.

52
00:02:59.331 --> 00:03:02.040
Hello, Fuli, Lion Guard.

53
00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.830
Long time no see.

54
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.540
Yeah, haven't seen you
since we kicked you out
of the Pride Lands.

55
00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:09.960
And I'm here to return
the favor.

56
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.500
You're in my territory now.

57
00:03:12.501 --> 00:03:13.750
So get out.

58
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.120
One, two, three, four,
five...

59
00:03:18.121 --> 00:03:19.250
I'm good.

60
00:03:19.251 --> 00:03:21.210
Hey, pick on somebody
your own size.

61
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.920
Why don't you?

62
00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:26.670
There's nobody my size here.

63
00:03:26.671 --> 00:03:29.750
Back off, Makucha. We don't
want any trouble.

64
00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:31.210
We're just passing through.

65
00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.380
You wouldn't want to mess
with us anyways.

66
00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.460
It's five against one.

67
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.880
(SCOFFS)
Four and a half maybe.

68
00:03:38.881 --> 00:03:39.880
Hey!

69
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.250
Oh, he means you.

70
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.380
Come on, Makucha.
Just let us through.

71
00:03:45.381 --> 00:03:46.250
I don't think so.

72
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.830

74
00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.120
Fine, you win.

75
00:03:56.121 --> 00:03:58.880
For now, but pass through
quickly.

76
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.750
And don't come back.

77
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.250
Let's go.

78
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.000
But keep your guard up.
I don't trust that guy.

79
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.880
You're right.
There he is again.

80
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.330
Come on out, Makucha.
We know you're in there.

81
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.170
Makucha?
Who's he?

82
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.460
Oh. Zebras. Don't worry.
We're friendly.

83
00:04:24.461 --> 00:04:27.210
Yeah, no need to panic
and run.

84
00:04:27.211 --> 00:04:28.830
Oh, we never panic and run.

85
00:04:28.831 --> 00:04:30.500

Dhahabu, hello, my name
is Kion.

153
00:07:27.171 --> 00:07:28.620
I'm here with the rest
of the Lion Guard...

154
00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.380
The Lion Guard?

155
00:07:30.381 --> 00:07:32.540
Are you here to guard me
from lions? (LAUGHS)

156
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:38.620
You know, there aren't any
lions is Dhahabu Grove.

157
00:07:38.621 --> 00:07:41.290
There are now.
Kion is a lion.

158
00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.670
Hmm, I thought lions
were bigger.

159
00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:47.830
Let me start over.
I'm the leader
of the Lion Guard.

160
00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.920
And this is Fuli, Beshte,
Bunga and Ono.

161
00:07:50.921 --> 00:07:52.080
Hey.
Nice to meet you.

162
00:07:52.081 --> 00:07:53.670
Hi. We've already met.

163
00:07:53.671 --> 00:07:56.620
Anyway, we're here for
the Pride Lands because...

164
00:07:56.621 --> 00:08:00.250
The Pride Lands? You came
all the way from the Pride
Lands?

165
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.620
How exciting!

166
00:08:02.621 --> 00:08:04.420
Prance with me.

167
00:08:04.421 --> 00:08:06.330
Whatever you say, Dhahabu.

168
00:08:06.331 --> 00:08:07.500
Seriously?

169
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:11.540
Kion, do we really have
time for this?

170
00:08:11.541 --> 00:08:13.790
We need to ask her
about that watering hole.

171
00:08:13.791 --> 00:08:16.580
I don't know, Fuli,
if we get to know Dhahabu,

172
00:08:16.581 --> 00:08:18.460
she might be more willing
to help us.

173
00:08:18.461 --> 00:08:21.710
Beshte's right. We need to
talk to her and make friends.

174
00:08:21.711 --> 00:08:23.170
Just like my dad said.

175
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:27.120
Welcome to Dhahabu Grove.

176
00:08:27.121 --> 00:08:29.670
The happiest place
in the Back Lands.

177
00:08:29.671 --> 00:08:31.710
(LAUGHING)

178
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:33.710
Wow, Dhahabu.

179
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:36.460
Everyone really does seem
to be happy.

180
00:08:36.461 --> 00:08:37.580
Of course.

181
00:08:37.581 --> 00:08:39.710
Good leaders keep
everyone happy,

182
00:08:39.711 --> 00:08:42.540
and in return,
everyone loves them.

183
00:08:42.541 --> 00:08:43.670
Right?

184
00:08:43.671 --> 00:08:45.000
My dad's a good leader.

185
00:08:45.001 --> 00:08:48.080
Everyone loves him 'cause
he tries to keep everyone safe.

186
00:08:48.081 --> 00:08:49.620
Hmm, really?

187
00:08:49.621 --> 00:08:52.620
Yes, and that's why
we're here.

188
00:08:52.621 --> 00:08:55.210
The Pride Lands have had
a tough dry season.

189
00:08:55.211 --> 00:08:56.460
We need more water.

190
00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:58.540
Oh, that's so sad.

191
00:08:58.880 --> 00:08:59.800
It is.

192
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.920
So my dad sent us to ask if
we can share your watering hole.

193
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:06.670
Our... Watering hole?

194
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.750
You do have one, right?

195
00:09:08.751 --> 00:09:09.710
Well...

196
00:09:09.711 --> 00:09:11.790
Of course we do.
It's huge.

197
00:09:11.791 --> 00:09:13.710
The biggest
in the Back Lands.

198
00:09:13.711 --> 00:09:15.620
And it would be fun to
meet the Pride Landers.

199
00:09:15.621 --> 00:09:17.040
Can we share it with them?

200
00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.330
BOTH: Please?

201
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.880
It would make my herd happy.
But...

202
00:09:24.881 --> 00:09:27.380
We'd be happy to do
something for you in return.

203
00:09:27.381 --> 00:09:28.580
Just name it.

204
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.710
Oh, I know!

205
00:09:31.711 --> 00:09:34.670
You can bring my herd
a Tamboa plant.

206
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.830
BOTH: A Tamboa plant?

207
00:09:37.831 --> 00:09:39.080
A Tamboa plant?

208
00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.210
Our favorite food.
A real delicacy.

209
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.710
But if you don't think
you're up to the task,

210
00:09:44.711 --> 00:09:45.830
I quite understand...

211
00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:48.620
You got it. One Tamboa plant,
coming up.

212
00:09:48.621 --> 00:09:49.670
Really?

213
00:09:49.671 --> 00:09:51.750
Sure, whatever you want.
Our pleasure.

214
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:56.120
Well, okay. Thank you.
And good luck.

215
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.040
Ono, you know what this
Tamboa plant looks like?

216
00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.790
Well, I saw one from
the sky once.

217
00:10:03.791 --> 00:10:07.620
But they're incredibly rare.
It could take us days to
even find one.

218
00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.500
But we don't have days,
do we?

219
00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:12.920
Nope. So we better get going.
Come on, Lion Guard.

220
00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:15.170
Bye, Dhahabu.

221
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:20.040
Any luck, Ono?

222
00:10:20.041 --> 00:10:21.040
Not yet.

223
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:24.710
Ugh, we've been wandering
through the Back Lands
for hours.

224
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.750
Come on, Fuli.
Ono's doing his best.

225
00:10:27.751 --> 00:10:30.000
He did say Tamboa plants
were rare.

226
00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:32.620
Sorry, everyone,
I'm still looking.

227
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:34.620
A-ha!

228
00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.920
Well?

229
00:10:36.921 --> 00:10:39.170
I've spotted a Tamboa plant,
but it's very far away.

230
00:10:39.171 --> 00:10:41.670
And it'll be nearly impossible
for us to get to it.

231
00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.540
Since when does "impossible"
stop us?

232
00:10:44.541 --> 00:10:46.120
We're the Lion Guard.

233
00:10:46.121 --> 00:10:47.580
I know, but...

234
00:10:47.581 --> 00:10:50.620
We'll find a way. A lot
of animals are counting
on us.

235
00:10:50.621 --> 00:10:52.170
Ono, take the lead.

236
00:10:52.171 --> 00:10:53.710
Affirmative.

237
00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:00.750
Ono, are you sure
this is the only way?

238
00:11:00.751 --> 00:11:02.380
Unfortunately, yes.

00:11:06.751 --> 00:11:08.540
Beshte, you okay?

242
00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.290
(STUTTERS) Yeah, I guess.

243
00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.250
You can do it, Big B.
It's easy, see?

244
00:11:13.251 --> 00:11:14.620
Careful, Little B.

245
00:11:14.621 --> 00:11:16.710
Don't worry about me,
I'm fine.

246
00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.960

247

249
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.000
Thanks, Fuli.

250
00:11:25.001 --> 00:11:27.670
For a second there, I thought
I was one gone mongoose.

251
00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.750
Hakuna Matata, Bunga.

252
00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.960
The Tamboa plant is
on the other side of
this thorn patch.

253
00:11:34.961 --> 00:11:37.120
You have to go around
to avoid the thorns.

254
00:11:37.121 --> 00:11:38.960
We don't have time
to go around.

255
00:11:38.961 --> 00:11:40.380
So let's go through.

256
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.620
Not all of us have thick
skin like you, Bunga.

257
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.920
Hmm. Maybe we can
go through.

258
00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:48.960
Beshte?

259
00:11:48.961 --> 00:11:51.250

You heard Beshte.
Let's follow him.

263
00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.040
Yeah.

264
00:12:05.041 --> 00:12:06.210
Whoo.

265
00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:08.420
Nice job, Beshte.

266
00:12:08.421 --> 00:12:10.880
Yeah, that was
un-Bunga-lievable.

267
00:12:10.881 --> 00:12:11.960
Are you okay?

268
00:12:11.961 --> 00:12:13.380
I think so.

269
00:12:13.381 --> 00:12:16.120
Good. 'Cause I think we'll
need you at full strength.

270
00:12:16.121 --> 00:12:17.960
That's a Tamboa plant?

271
00:12:17.961 --> 00:12:20.210
Ono, you said it was rare.

272
00:12:20.211 --> 00:12:22.040
You didn't say it was huge.

273
00:12:22.041 --> 00:12:23.460
It looked smaller
from the sky.

274
00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:26.960
We're supposed to carry this
thing back to the zebras?

275
00:12:26.961 --> 00:12:28.080
Seriously?

276
00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:29.790
Ah, leave it to me.

277
00:12:29.791 --> 00:12:31.880
Come on, plantly lanty.
Here we go.

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:38.210
How're we gonna get that
thing out of the ground?

280
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:41.580
Well, if we can't pull it out,
maybe we can dig it out.

281
00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:42.960
Wait.

Great job, Beshte.

297

Now let's get that plant
back to Dhahabu.

gonna panic and run.

Why would we do that?

304
00:13:44.121 --> 00:13:46.920
We're just surprised to
see a walking Tamboa plant.

305
00:13:46.921 --> 00:13:49.080
It's Beshte doing the walking,
see?

306
00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.670
Okay, Dhahabu. One Tamboa
plant, as requested.

307
00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:59.000
I... I never thought you'd
actually find one.

308
00:13:59.001 --> 00:14:00.080
What?

309
00:14:00.081 --> 00:14:01.880
I mean, I hoped you would.

310
00:14:01.881 --> 00:14:04.080
I'm just surprised.

311
00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:07.830
It wasn't easy. But we
delivered our side of
the deal.

312
00:14:07.831 --> 00:14:10.040
So if you could show us
the watering hole...

313
00:14:10.041 --> 00:14:11.290
We will! We will!

314
00:14:11.291 --> 00:14:12.290
No!

315
00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.120
I'm sorry, the deal's off.

316
00:14:15.121 --> 00:14:17.040
We can't share
our watering hole.

317
00:14:17.041 --> 00:14:18.120
What?
But...

318
00:14:18.121 --> 00:14:19.420
Why not?

319
00:14:19.421 --> 00:14:21.120
What do you mean you can't
share the watering hole?

320
00:14:21.121 --> 00:14:23.620
It's... It's, um,
against the rules.

321
00:14:23.621 --> 00:14:24.830
What rules?

322
00:14:24.831 --> 00:14:27.960
The... The, uh,
secret rules.

323
00:14:27.961 --> 00:14:30.000
We never heard of
any secret rules.

324
00:14:30.001 --> 00:14:31.960
That's because they're
secret.

325
00:14:31.961 --> 00:14:34.880
In fact, you're not allowed
to go to the watering hole
either.

326
00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:36.330
Huh?
What?

327
00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:39.210
That's right. Nobody can
use the watering hole.

send us to get that plant,

00:14:46.881 --> 00:14:49.040
if she wasn't going to let
us share the water?

332
00:14:49.041 --> 00:14:51.330
I think Dhahabu's
hiding something.

333
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:54.170
Ono, try to get a look
at the watering hole.

334
00:14:54.171 --> 00:14:56.540
Maybe there's reason she
doesn't want us to use it.

I know why Dhahabu doesn't
want us to see the watering

339
00:15:09.041 --> 00:15:11.120
Why?
Because it's empty.

340

The watering hole
is all dried up.

342
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.120
It's empty?

The bird must be seeing
things.

345
00:15:20.001 --> 00:15:21.620
I've seen things all right,

346
00:15:21.621 --> 00:15:24.460
but maybe they're things you
don't want anyone else to see.

347
00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:28.170
(LAUGHS) What a funny
bird he is.

348
00:15:28.171 --> 00:15:30.210
Why didn't you tell us,
Dhahabu?

349
00:15:30.211 --> 00:15:32.210
This makes us really
unhappy.

350

We can frolic!
And romp!

352
00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:46.040
So you knew the watering
hole had dried up?

353
00:15:46.041 --> 00:15:49.250
Yes, I saw it a few days ago.

354
00:15:49.251 --> 00:15:50.960
But I don't know
where the water went.

355
00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:52.750
Why didn't you
tell your herd?

356
00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:55.000
I didn't want to
make them unhappy.

357
00:15:55.001 --> 00:15:57.540
But zebras can only go
a few days without water.

358
00:15:57.830 --> 00:15:59.330
What were you planning
to do?

359
00:15:59.331 --> 00:16:00.540
I don't know.

360
00:16:00.541 --> 00:16:03.210
I guess I hoped it would
fill itself up again.

361
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:04.960
Seriously?

362
00:16:04.961 --> 00:16:07.330
A good leader tells her
herd the truth, Dhahabu.

363
00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:08.880
Even if it's bad news.

364
00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:12.170
And when there's a problem,
a good leader tries to help.

365
00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:15.120
You're right. I just don't
know what to do.

366
00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:17.080
How about a hug?

367
00:16:17.081 --> 00:16:19.000
We can do better
than that, Bunga.

368
00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:22.170
We'll go to the watering hole
and see if we can figure out

369
00:16:22.171 --> 00:16:23.250
what happened to the water.

370
00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:24.670
Do you think
you can fix it?

371
00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:27.040
I don't know
but if we can,

372
00:16:27.041 --> 00:16:29.290
will you agree to share it
with the Pride Landers?

373
00:16:29.291 --> 00:16:32.000
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

374
00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:34.290
Lion Guard, let's go
take a look.

375
00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.710
Any idea why it dried up?

376
00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.670
Well, there used to be
a waterfall over there.

377
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.670
Could that have something
to do with it?

378
00:16:44.671 --> 00:16:46.250
Uh, yeah.

379
00:16:46.251 --> 00:16:47.080
Ono.

380
00:16:47.081 --> 00:16:48.080
On it.

381
00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.120
I see the problem.

382
00:16:52.121 --> 00:16:54.250
A rock slide blocked
the waterfall.

383
00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:58.080
Okay, maybe we can unblock it
and let the water flow again.

384
00:16:58.081 --> 00:17:00.620
Lion Guard, let's get to
the top of that cliff.

385
00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:04.080
Wait, that's leopard
territory.

386
00:17:04.081 --> 00:17:06.080
We'll take our chances.

387
00:17:06.081 --> 00:17:07.500
Do it all the time.

388
00:17:07.501 --> 00:17:09.120
Then take me with you.

389
00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:13.830
Um, I don't know if
that's such a good idea.

390
00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:16.210
Leopards usually aren't
very nice.

391
00:17:16.211 --> 00:17:17.500
Just leave it to us.

392
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:19.250

a good leader does something
about it."

394
00:17:23.251 --> 00:17:24.920
And I wanna be a good leader.

395
00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:28.250
Okay, Dhahabu, come on.

396
00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:31.120
There's the rock slide.

397
00:17:31.121 --> 00:17:32.330
Thanks, Ono.

398
00:17:32.331 --> 00:17:34.670
Beshte, think you can
move those boulders?

399
00:17:34.671 --> 00:17:36.040
Sure thing, Kion.

No.

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:45.620
It was me.

405
00:17:45.621 --> 00:17:48.330
I thought you were
just passing through.

406
00:17:48.331 --> 00:17:51.080
Now you wanna take
my water? (GROWLS)

We're not taking it,
Makucha.

408
00:17:53.381 --> 00:17:56.330
We just wanna move the rocks
so the zebras can have water
too.
