a legend, Jasiri.

inside the volcano.

tell you sooner.

If you want,

84

I could ask for your clan
to stay here
in the Pride Lands.

for us to help.

Scar may know about me
and the little ones.

97

But he doesn't know
about all of us.

While the Guard is protecting
the Pride Lands,

99
00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:29.750
we can ruin Scar's plans here.
