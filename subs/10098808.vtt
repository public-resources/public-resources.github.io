And we all have
our own to take care of.

Yes. And I'm very proud
of how much you've grown

395
00:18:34.619 --> 00:18:36.499
as the leader
of the Lion Guard.

396
00:18:36.499 --> 00:18:37.749
Thanks, Dad.

397
00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:40.080
Janja!

398
00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.460
I'm hungrier than ever!

399
00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:46.749
Yeah. I'd eat
just about anything!

400
00:18:46.749 --> 00:18:49.669
Janja! Janja, look!
Up there!

401
00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:51.250
A snake!

402
00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:53.120
Ooh, ooh!
Can we eat it?

403
00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.540
Better than nuthin',
I guess.

404
00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:56.669
C'mon boys!

405
00:18:56.710 --> 00:19:00.250
Now that I know Kion's
been getting advice
from Mufasa,

406
00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:03.579
I'll finally have some
leverage with the Lion Guard.

407
00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:06.710
Then everyone
in the Pride Lands
will respect me.

408
00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:09.249
Yessssss!

409
00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:12.750
I won't be the one
who gets trampled
or pounced on anymore!

410
00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:15.419
Ahhh!
That's what
you think! (LAUGHS)

411
00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.880

Janaja?

412
00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.209
What do you want with me?

413
00:19:19.209 --> 00:19:20.879
We wanna eat ya!

414
00:19:20.879 --> 00:19:22.829
But I'm just a snake.

415
00:19:22.829 --> 00:19:25.039
Wouldn't you want
something meatier?

416
00:19:25.039 --> 00:19:28.249
Oh, we would
if it weren't for Kion.

417
00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:30.170
Forcin' us to stay
in the Outlands.

418
00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:33.500
Instead of lettin' us eat
whatever we want
in the Pride Lands.

419
00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:37.289
Well if Kion's your problem,
I might have a solution.

420
00:19:37.289 --> 00:19:39.379
What?
Yes.

421
00:19:39.421 --> 00:19:43.461
The reason Kion is so
successful leading
the Lion Guard,

422
00:19:43.461 --> 00:19:47.370
is because he's getting advice
from the greatest lion
to rule the Pride Lands.

423
00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:48.459
Mufasa!

424
00:19:48.459 --> 00:19:50.669
(SCOFFS) Mufasa?

425
00:19:50.711 --> 00:19:53.871
I think you've been pounced on
one too many times, snake.

426
00:19:53.871 --> 00:19:55.789
The name's Ushari.

427
00:19:55.789 --> 00:19:58.919
And if you want to outsmart
the Lion Guard, Janja,

428
00:19:58.919 --> 00:20:01.829
you need to start
thinking like lions!

429
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:03.750
Great lions!

430
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:05.830
In case you hadn't
noticed Ushari,

431
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:08.379
we're hyenas, not lions.

432
00:20:08.379 --> 00:20:10.249
Yeah, that's right!

433
00:20:10.249 --> 00:20:11.619
(CHUCKLES)
We sure ain't!

434
00:20:11.619 --> 00:20:14.619
And there ain't no lion
that's gonna help us hyenas.

435
00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:16.670
Let alone a great one!

436
00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:19.210
(HYENAS LAUGHING)

437
00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:22.919
But there was one great lion
who helped hyenas.

438
00:20:23.619 --> 00:20:25.079
Oh, you mean Scar?

439
00:20:25.079 --> 00:20:27.329
Hate to break it
to ya, Ushari.

440
00:20:27.371 --> 00:20:31.461
But Scar died in the fire
at Pride Rock a long time ago.

441
00:20:31.461 --> 00:20:35.289
Yes. But if Kion
can talk to Mufasa,

442
00:20:35.289 --> 00:20:38.879
there must be a way
for us to speak to Scar.

443
00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.790
Huh, you think?

444
00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:42.750
I'm certain!

445
00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:45.539
It's just a question of how!

446
00:20:45.539 --> 00:20:47.749
How do we talk to Scar?

447
00:20:47.749 --> 00:20:50.919
I need to gather
some more information first.

448
00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.920
If you'll let me go.

449
00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:54.500
Yeah, all right.

450
00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.329
But we're gonna follow you
the whole time.

451
00:20:56.329 --> 00:20:58.499
In case you're makin'
all this up.

452
00:20:58.499 --> 00:20:59.749
Fair enough.

453
00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:04.500
I believe I know someone
who will give us

454
00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.000
all the information
we need.

455
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.539
Without even realizing
she's helping us!

456
00:21:11.289 --> 00:21:12.619
Hello, stick.

457
00:21:12.619 --> 00:21:14.959
Are you my new staff?

458
00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.250
Nope.
(STICK CLATTERS)

459
00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:17.330
How about you?

460
00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:19.460
Anything to say to me?

461
00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:20.499
Anything?

462
00:21:20.499 --> 00:21:23.289
USHARI: Well!
If it isn't Makini!

463
00:21:23.289 --> 00:21:24.789
Was that a stick?

464
00:21:25.459 --> 00:21:27.579
Oh. You're a snake.

465
00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:29.290
Not a stick.

466
00:21:29.331 --> 00:21:33.661
True. But I've heard
that you are Rafiki's
new apprentice.

467
00:21:33.661 --> 00:21:36.459
Oh, yes! I've just started
studying with him!

468
00:21:36.459 --> 00:21:37.879
It's so exciting!

469
00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.380
I'm sure it is.

470
00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:42.460
And he couldn't have
picked a more worthy mandril.

471
00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:44.419
Oh, thank you!

472
00:21:44.419 --> 00:21:47.579
Yes, of course.

473
00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:51.620
I suppose this means
you can speak
to the Lions of the Past?

474
00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:55.420
Like how Kion
speaks to Mufasa?
What?

475
00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:57.539
How does a snake
like you know that?

476
00:21:57.539 --> 00:21:59.539
Oh. Uh, well...

477
00:21:59.539 --> 00:22:02.959
I'm friends with Kion
and the Lion Guard.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.460
We go way back.

479
00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:05.670
Oh.

480
00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:07.880
Then you know only the lions
in Simba's Pride

481
00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.499
and the royal Mjuzi can hear
the Lions of the Past.

482
00:22:10.499 --> 00:22:12.499
Yes, yes.

483
00:22:12.499 --> 00:22:14.789
But does that include
the evil lions?

484
00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:16.580
Like Scar?

485
00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:18.210
Can you speak to him as well?

486
00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:20.459
Oh!
What a frightening thought.

487
00:22:20.459 --> 00:22:22.499
I never even
thought about that!

488
00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:25.870
I'd have to ask Rafiki
if there's a way
to hear them. (GASPS)

00:24:07.461 --> 00:24:09.749
Follow them?
Into a lair?

527
00:24:09.749 --> 00:24:12.619
We can't be seen
rompin' round
the Pride Lands.

528
00:24:12.619 --> 00:24:14.579
So it's gotta be you.

529
00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:16.710
Ya got a problem with that?

530
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:18.170
Listen, Janja.

531
00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:19.789
Talking to Makini
is one thing.

532
00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:23.620
But I can't slither
fast enough to keep up
with her and Rafiki!

533
00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:25.789
Sure, sure. I understand.

534
00:24:25.789 --> 00:24:28.959
After all, if you'd rather
be our dinner...

535
00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:32.380
(CHUCKLING) Dinner time!

536
00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:34.789
Yummy yum yum!

537
00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:36.379
No, no. Of course not!

538
00:24:36.379 --> 00:24:37.749
It's just that...

539
00:24:37.749 --> 00:24:40.789
I have some friends
who move much faster than me.

540
00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:43.960
And they're
excellent spies.

541
00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.709
Friends?
Yes.

542
00:24:46.709 --> 00:24:48.709
Skinks! Come out!

543
00:24:48.709 --> 00:24:50.579
I know you're there!

544
00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.880
Ew. What are they?

545
00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:58.539
I dunno, but they're spooky!

546
00:24:58.539 --> 00:25:00.879
Hello, Ushari.
You called?

547
00:25:00.879 --> 00:25:02.379
I did.

548
00:25:02.421 --> 00:25:05.921
Can one of your skinks follow
Rafiki and Makini for us?

549
00:25:05.921 --> 00:25:07.210
Of course.

550
00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:10.249
But there better be
something in it for us.

551
00:25:10.249 --> 00:25:11.669
If all goes well,

552
00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:15.830
it could tip the balance
of the Pride Lands
in our favor.

553
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:18.670
Hmm. Sounds interesting...

554
00:25:19.289 --> 00:25:20.829
Nyeusi, hurry!

555
00:25:20.829 --> 00:25:22.329
Follow Rafiki and Makini!

556
00:25:22.329 --> 00:25:24.039
Tell us where they go!

557
00:25:24.039 --> 00:25:27.829
Nyeusi is
the stealthiest skink.

558
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:29.750
Rafiki will never see him.

559
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:31.000
He's lucky.

560
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.119
These skinks
give me the creeps!

561
00:25:33.119 --> 00:25:35.669
(CHUCKLING) Me too!

562
00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:39.330
I'm so excited Rafiki!

563
00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:42.040
I can't believe I'm finally
starting my training!

564
00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.170
I can't wait to learn
how to hear them!

565
00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:46.040
RAFIKI: This way,
Makini. This way!

566
00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:48.749
Lion Guard! Come!

567
00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:51.380
I have someone
I want you to meet.

568
00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:53.830
This is my new apprentice.

569
00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:54.710
Makini!

570
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:57.670
Makini,
this is the Lion Guard.

571
00:25:57.670 --> 00:25:59.249
And their Lair.

572
00:25:59.249 --> 00:26:00.379
Hi ya, Makini!

573
00:26:00.379 --> 00:26:01.919
Greetings!
Nice to meet you.

574
00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.210
Hi again, Makini.

575
00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:04.620
Hi, Kion.

576
00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:07.880
And wow! It's so fantastic
to meet the rest of you!

577
00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.790
I mean, obviously
I've seen you all before

578
00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:11.169
while you're going around
the Pride Lands,

579
00:26:11.169 --> 00:26:12.829
being all strong.

580
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:13.790
And brave.

581
00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:14.920
And fast.

582
00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.540
And keenest of sight!
(SQUAWKS)

583
00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:18.710
And always saving the day!

584
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:20.750
Yep. That's us all right!

585
00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:23.790
And it's so exciting
to meet you all
up close and personal!

586
00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:26.379
I'm sure it is.
It is!

587
00:26:26.421 --> 00:26:29.711
But I have to say,
I really admire you
the most, Fuli.

588
00:26:29.711 --> 00:26:33.331
Rafiki says you're
the only girl to ever
be on the Lion Guard!

589
00:26:33.331 --> 00:26:34.749
As in, ever!

590
00:26:34.749 --> 00:26:35.959
Uh, I am?

591
00:26:35.959 --> 00:26:37.249
It is true.

592
00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:39.710
Yeah! You've got
to be so proud!

593
00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:41.620
I'm proud
and I'm not even you!

594
00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:43.670
Thanks, Makini.
Sure!

595
00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:46.540
So Rafiki, why are you
taking on an apprentice?

596
00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:48.959
Are you okay?
Yes, Beshte, yes.

597
00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.210
I am fine.

598
00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:54.880
You see, when Makini was born,

599
00:26:54.921 --> 00:26:58.371
the Lions of the Past told me
that she would be the one

600
00:26:58.371 --> 00:27:01.879
to continue my role
in the Circle of Life.

601
00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:04.830
And now that the stripes
have appeared on her face,

602
00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:08.880
it is time for Makini
to begin her training!

603
00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.999
Rafiki? Did you do
all of those paintings?

604
00:27:11.999 --> 00:27:13.539
Only some.

605
00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:16.330
Most were done by those
who came before me.

606
00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:19.670
And someday it will be
your turn to paint them!

607
00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:20.790
(LAUGHS)

608
00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:23.079
Okay...

609
00:27:23.079 --> 00:27:26.709
Kion, can you assemble
the Royal Family on Pride Rock

610
00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:28.880
for Makini's
formal introduction?

611
00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.460
Sure, Rafiki. I'll make sure
we're all there.

612
00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:39.250
This is the place?

613
00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:42.830
Yep. Nyeusi says
Rafiki and Makini
went in there.

614
00:27:42.871 --> 00:27:47.541
But if you ask me,
we're already too close
to Pride Rock for comfort.

615
00:27:47.541 --> 00:27:49.169
That's fine.

616
00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:50.920
I'll take it from here.

617
00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.290
Thanks, Shupavu.

618
00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:54.330
Yeah. Let's get outta here.

619
00:27:57.499 --> 00:28:00.539
So, Rafiki? Can I try out
my bakora staff now?

620
00:28:00.539 --> 00:28:03.459
Wait. Your staff can bring
paintings to life too?

621
00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:05.380
RAFIKI: We shall
soon find out.

622
00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:07.080
Go ahead, Makini.

623
00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:14.500
(ROARS)

624
00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.540
Whoa!
Look at that!

625
00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:18.710
MAKINI: It worked!
ONO: I'll say!

626
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:19.920
So!

627
00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:23.880
Makini's staff is more
than a simple stick!

628
00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:27.829
It seems you have
chosen your
staff well, Makini.

629
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:29.380
That's Scar, isn't it?

630
00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:33.330
Yeah. The worst lion to ever
live in the Pride Lands!

631
00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:35.499
Ooh. That reminds me, Rafiki.

632
00:28:35.499 --> 00:28:37.169
My question.
From earlier?

633
00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:38.830
Yes.

634
00:28:38.871 --> 00:28:41.871
I know the bakora staff
can help me hear
the Great Lions of the Past.

635
00:28:41.871 --> 00:28:46.041
But is there a way
to hear the Bad Lions
of the Past too?

636
00:28:46.041 --> 00:28:49.749
Hmm. That is
a serious question,
young one.

637
00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:55.830
But, you must know the bad
as well as the good.

638
00:28:55.871 --> 00:29:01.291
As you know, Makini,
your bakora not only brings
images of the past to life.

639
00:29:01.291 --> 00:29:04.960
It can help you hear
the Lions of the Past.

640
00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:07.960
The Great Lions of the Past
are in the sky.

641
00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:10.750
Their voices are in the wind.

642
00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:13.419
And you have all seen Kion
use the Roar

643
00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:15.880
to make those
Great Lions appear.

644
00:29:15.921 --> 00:29:21.001
But the Roar can also summon
the worst lions
of the Pride Lands past.

645
00:29:21.001 --> 00:29:25.879
Instead of clouds,
these lions appear in fire.

646
00:29:25.921 --> 00:29:32.541
Once summoned,
the bakora can be used
to talk to evil lions as well.

647
00:29:32.541 --> 00:29:35.460
All the evil lions?
Even Scar?

648
00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:37.959
Yes. Even Scar.

649
00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:40.170
Yes!

650
00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:41.960
(SHUDDERS)
Whoa!

651
00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.290
Creepy!

652
00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:45.790
You said it, Bunga.
Totally.

653
00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:47.749
Thank you
for telling me, Rafiki.

654
00:29:47.749 --> 00:29:49.959
Of course, young one.
Of course.

655
00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:51.120
But remember.

656
00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.960
Talking to bad lions?

657
00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:56.250
It is a bad idea! (LAUGHS)

658
00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:58.880
Got it!
I totally understand!

659
00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:01.379
And so do I.

660
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.380
Now, it is time.

661
00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:07.000
Time to present
Makini to Simba

662
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.620
and the rest
of the Royal Family!

663
00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:11.119
(LAUGHS)

664
00:30:11.119 --> 00:30:13.289
This way, Makini!
(GASPS AND GIGGLES)

665
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.880
Good luck, Makini!

666
00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:21.080
I'm looking forward
to meeting
Rafiki's apprentice.

667
00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:22.460
You've already
met her, Kion?

668
00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:24.039
Unofficially, yeah.

669
00:30:24.039 --> 00:30:28.999
She's, uh, very talkative.

670
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.290
Any word on Ma Tembo's
first water hunt?

671
00:30:31.331 --> 00:30:34.661
According to Ono's
last report,
she's still searching.

672
00:30:34.661 --> 00:30:38.790
Can you imagine anything
more boring than having
to look for water?

673
00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:40.120
No. (CHUCKLES)

674
00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.290
It's not so boring
if you're thirsty.

675
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.620
Mom? Dad?

676
00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:47.000
Would it be okay
if I tried to help Ma Tembo?

677
00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:50.210
I'm not sure there's anything
you can do to help, Kiara.

678
00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:52.000
I'd at least like to try.

679
00:30:52.041 --> 00:30:56.461
Finding the new water source
is Ma Tembo's responsibility.

680
00:30:56.461 --> 00:30:59.540
But even if you can't find
the water yourself,

681
00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:03.080
it might be a good experience
for you to learn
to work with Ma Tembo.

682
00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:05.380
Especially as future Queen.

683
00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:07.000
MAKINI: Oh, oh!
Can I help?

684
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.330
If the future Queen
is going on a mission,

685
00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:10.829
I'd like to go too!

686
00:31:10.829 --> 00:31:13.619
I'm Makini!
Rafiki's new apprentice!

687
00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:14.960
RAFIKI: Makini!

688
00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:17.540
The official introduction
is for me to do.

689
00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:20.120
But why would Makini
introduce you?

690
00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:23.250
Yeah! We already know
who you are, Rafiki.

691
00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:26.749
Rafiki is supposed
to introduce Makini.

692
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:29.210
Oh! Now that makes sense.

693
00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:31.580
Yes, yes.
Stand here, Makini.

694
00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:34.080
King Simba.
Queen Nala.

695
00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:36.329
Royal family and friends.

696
00:31:36.329 --> 00:31:40.789
May I present
my new apprentice Makini!

697
00:31:40.831 --> 00:31:44.921
It's a great honor
to be chosen
as the next knowledge keeper

698
00:31:44.921 --> 00:31:46.290
for the Pride Lands.

699
00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:50.250
But as Royal Mjuzi,
you are always welcome
at Pride Rock.

700
00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:52.880
Yes. It's a pleasure
to meet you, Makini.

701
00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.830
Thank you, your majesties.

702
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:59.500
Someday, Makini will be
Royal Mjuzi for Queen Kiara.

703
00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.829
Then maybe Makini
should come with me

704
00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:04.040
to help Ma Tembo
and the elephants find water.

705
00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:05.960
Ooh yes, yes!

706
00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:08.080
They will have to learn
to work together.

707
00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:09.420
Just like you and Rafiki do.

708
00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:11.999
That is true.
Eh, Simba?

709
00:32:11.999 --> 00:32:13.499
Yes.

710
00:32:13.541 --> 00:32:16.751
And the sooner they learn
how to work together,
the better.

711
00:32:16.751 --> 00:32:18.750
Oh thank you,
your highnesses!

712
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:20.460
Thank you, thank you,
thank you!

713
00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:22.210
You're welcome, Makini.

714
00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:24.079
Okay,
my future advisor.

715
00:32:24.079 --> 00:32:26.209
Let's go!

716
00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:29.170
Wait. I thought we were
Kiara's royal advisors.

717
00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:32.500
Yeah! She can't go looking
for water without us!

718
00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:34.330
Wait! We're coming, too!

719
00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:37.379
Ladies? Why don't
we let Kiara
get to know Makini.

720
00:32:37.379 --> 00:32:39.539
You can stay here
on Pride Rock. With me.

721
00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:42.500
With you?

722
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:46.040
Oh, um, yes,
Your Majesty! Yes!

723
00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.249
Of course!

724
00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:50.420
I'm so excited to be working
with you, Princess Kiara!

725
00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:53.290
I'm sure I can learn
so much from you!

726
00:32:53.290 --> 00:32:54.710
Good luck, Kiara.

727
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:56.920
Thanks, Kion.
MAKINI: C'mon,
Princess Kiara!

728
00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:59.710
Let's go!
I might need it.

729
00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:06.420
So, there is a way
to talk to Scar!

730
00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:07.790
Yes.

731
00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:12.170
According to Rafiki,
the evil lions appear in fire.

732
00:33:12.170 --> 00:33:15.209
Well, one little eruption
of this here volcano

733
00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:17.250
and we'll get
plenty of fire!

734
00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:19.580
Yeah, right!
Plenty of it!

735
00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:21.120
(ALL LAUGHING)

736
00:33:22.329 --> 00:33:23.539
Yes.

737
00:33:23.539 --> 00:33:26.539
We'll also need
Rafiki or Makini's staff.

738
00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:29.210
The staff will allow us
to speak to Scar.

739
00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:31.080
We'll go after Makini.

740
00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:34.170
One little mandrill's
no match for us hyenas.

741
00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:35.169
I agree.

742
00:33:35.169 --> 00:33:38.709
So the real question is,
how do we lure Kion

743
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:41.120
to the volcano
and make him Roar?

744
00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:43.330
We'll want him to give us
a big Roar, too.

745
00:33:43.330 --> 00:33:47.000
One that will make
the volcano erupt in flames!

746
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.749
Ooh, ooh! I know. I know.

747
00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:52.750
Kion Roared real big
the time we tried
to eat Bunga!

748
00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:54.210
(CHUCKLES) Yeah!

749
00:33:54.251 --> 00:33:57.621
And his Roar was even bigger
when we went after his mom.

750
00:33:57.621 --> 00:34:00.120
It even made
the ground open up!

751
00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:02.419
What? Janja, is this true?

752
00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:05.670
Yeah, yeah.
The fur brains
are actually right.

753
00:34:05.711 --> 00:34:09.921
Kion's Roars are huge
when his friends and family
are threatened!

754
00:34:09.921 --> 00:34:12.249
Then that's what
we have to do.

755
00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:17.120
Target someone
Kion cares about,
and bring them here!

756
00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:18.290
Yeah.

757
00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:23.210
And then when Kion roars,
we can bring back a legend!

758
00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:24.459

I'm sure it will be
any minute.

801

Well it better be!
I'm parched!

802
00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:35.500
So is there anything
we can do to help?

803
00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:37.209
I don't know if there is.

804
00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:40.500
I believe we're in
the general area
of the new water source.

805
00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:42.500
But I haven't found
the well site yet.

806
00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:44.420
Maybe we could look around
for wet rocks,

807
00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:46.420
or some other sign
of underground water?

808
00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:47.879
Oh, yes.

809
00:36:47.879 --> 00:36:49.379
That would be helpful.

And, thank you, your highness.

you had back there, Makini.

Well, I really
admire you Kiara.

to the Circle of Life.

find water is even more...

871
00:39:13.871 --> 00:39:15.040
Then you should go.

872
00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:17.330
Janja may need your help
down below.

873
00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:18.960

I don't know
what you're thinking, Janja.

877
00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:32.499
But you're not gonna
get away with this!

878
00:39:32.499 --> 00:39:33.919
That's what you think.

879
00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:36.580
Chungu, toss her in.
(GRUNTS)

880
00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:39.670
That ought to keep you.

881
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:41.080
I don't think so.

882
00:39:41.999 --> 00:39:42.999
Ahh!

883
00:39:43.619 --> 00:39:45.419
Oh.

884
00:39:45.419 --> 00:39:48.539
(LAUGHING) Yeah!

885
00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:50.330
How about that, cub?

886
00:39:50.330 --> 00:39:52.380
That steam is really hot!

888
00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:55.379
Gotta tell Kion.

00:39:57.669 --> 00:39:59.209
ONO: Everyone! Everyone!

890
00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:00.540
Ono! What do you see?

891
00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:02.290
Kiara seems okay.

892
00:40:02.331 --> 00:40:05.501
But the hyenas
have her surrounded,
and trapped by steam vents.

893
00:40:05.501 --> 00:40:06.880
What's Janja up to?

894
00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:09.579
The only reason
he'd hold Kiara prisoner

895
00:40:09.579 --> 00:40:12.039
is because he wants
something from me or my Dad.

896
00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:13.830
Like what?
Who cares?

897
00:40:13.871 --> 00:40:17.331
We go in, Kion Roars,
and we come back out
with Kiara!

898
00:40:17.331 --> 00:40:19.500
I'm not sure it's gonna be
as easy as that, Bunga.

899
00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:21.169
Indeed.

900
00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:23.250
Kion won't want
to Roar at the hyenas
if they're surrounding Kiara.

901
00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:25.710
Oh, yeah...
I have an idea.

902
00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:29.040
The hyenas will be expecting
me to come to the rescue.

903
00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:31.460
But if they think
I'm the only one here,

904
00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:34.079
I might be able to lure them
away from Kiara.

905
00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:36.500
Then we'll only have to get
past the steam vents.

906
00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:37.750
And I think I know
how to do that.

907
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:40.170
All right!
Now we're talking!

908
00:40:40.211 --> 00:40:44.331
Okay. I'll go this way
and try to distract
Janja and the others.

909
00:40:44.331 --> 00:40:48.000
Ono, scout a route
the other way so the hyenas
won't see us coming.

Affirmative! Follow me!

That's what he said.

925
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.040
Then maybe
we should sing to her!

why I'm here, Janja.

936
00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:48.670
Just let Kiara go.

937

Or there's gonna be trouble.

938
00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:52.540

We both know
I don't need the Guard
for back up.

Roar at us then, huh?

back just'cause you say so.

exactly the way we hoped.

What do you mean?

ONO: So far, Kion's only lured
Janja away from Kiara.

955

The rest of the hyenas
are still guarding Kiara
at the steam vents!

956
00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:37.670
And... They appear
to be singing to her.

It won't be easy.

960
00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:44.920

by hyenas and the steam vents!

970
00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:08.580
You dragged my sister
to the Outlands.

You're holding her prisoner.

972
00:43:10.249 --> 00:43:12.329
And you're doing
all of this,

973
00:43:12.330 --> 00:43:14.750
because you want me
to leave you alone?

974
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:16.880
Uh, yeah!
That's right!

975
00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:19.880

00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:33.329
You okay, Kiara?

1047
00:46:33.329 --> 00:46:34.999
(SIGHS) I'll be fine.

1048
00:46:34.999 --> 00:46:36.209
Thanks, Lion Guard.

1049
00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:37.790

Come on, Kiara.

1051
00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:40.710
Let's get you home.

1052
00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:44.750
You okay, Kion?

1053
00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:46.789
I let Janja get to me.

1054
00:46:46.789 --> 00:46:48.619
I got really angry.

1055
00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:51.290
And I kinda lost control
of the Roar.

1056
00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:52.500
We noticed.

1057
00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:54.880
You kinda made
that giant volcano erupt.

1058
00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:56.710
Which, by the way,

1059
00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:59.209
was totally
un-Bunga-lievable!

1060
00:46:59.210 --> 00:47:01.080
Yeah, I guess it was.

1061
00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:03.040
And we're all okay.

1062
00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:04.380
Even Kiara.

1063
00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:06.960
I guess that's
what really counts.

1064

nothing else bad happened.

So, Ushari,
where's Scar?

1068
00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:20.960
It, uh,

1069
00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:24.709
seems our plan
didn't exactly work.

1070

It what?
After all that?

1071

finds the water soon.

Yes! I need a drink!

1082

Still no luck,
Ma Tembo?

1083

No, not yet.

to find the new water!

Even with my ears,
I'll never hear where it is.
