MAKUCHA: Oh, I don't think so.

6
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.880
We wanna get
to the Tree of Life

7
00:01:09.881 --> 00:01:12.380
and I don't think
you can stop us.

8
00:01:12.381 --> 00:01:15.000
Look at them.
They're exhausted.

9
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.250
(YAWNS) So tired.

10
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.500

The sleepy lion is mine.

15
00:01:29.461 --> 00:01:31.830
How about a lion
that's not so sleepy?

16
00:01:31.831 --> 00:01:34.000
And his not-so-sleepy friends.

17
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.330
Thought you
could use some help, Ra...

18
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.210
Uh, Your Majesty.

19
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.580
Thanks. It's
been a long night.

20
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.330
Kion, use the Roar.
Blast those baddies.

21
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.830
No. I can't.

22
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.920

Kion, I spotted Chuluun.
She's in the trees.

27
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.080
Fuli, go get Chuluun.

28
00:02:05.081 --> 00:02:07.830

Ah, right. Of course.
How can we help?

35
00:02:22.331 --> 00:02:24.250
You and the Lion Guard
handle Ora.

36
00:02:24.251 --> 00:02:26.040
The Night Pride
will take the leopards.

KION: Sorry, Rani.

50
00:03:07.081 --> 00:03:10.620
We came to help.
But I kind of made
things worse.

51
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.790
Your team did help, Kion, but

52
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.290
from now on,
follow my lead.

53
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.210
What? But Kion's great
at taking the lead.

54
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.620
I know Kion has potential
to be a great leader, but...

55
00:03:21.621 --> 00:03:23.170
Potential?

56
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:25.960
Kion's already a great leader.
Am I?

57
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.670
I became leader
of the Lion Guard

58
00:03:28.671 --> 00:03:29.670
when I got the Roar.

59
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.250
But now, I can't
control the Roar.

60
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.750
I've been messing things up
like I did just now.

61
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:37.670
Maybe I shouldn't be leading.

62

FULI: Kion, seriously?

63
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.790
Kion can't control the Roar.

64
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.500
And he doesn't wanna lead.

65
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.620
At least until
my scar is healed.

could use some rest.

(SIGHS) Mama Binturong
and the others never give up.

69
00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:56.960
They'll be back.

70
00:03:56.961 --> 00:03:59.330
The Lion Guard could patrol
during the day while you rest.

71
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.120
Then the Night Pride
could go back

72
00:04:02.121 --> 00:04:03.500
to patrolling only at night.

73
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.330
Oh, we could use the help.

74
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.420
Especially now that I'm Queen

75
00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.210
and leader of the Night Pride.

76
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.620

leader needs help.

Mama's got a plan.

79
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.040
Okay, then the Lion Guard will
start patrolling right away.

80
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.620
Not you, Kion.

81
00:04:24.621 --> 00:04:25.830
You're coming with me.

82
00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.830
Then the rest
of the Lion Guard
will start right away.

83
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.460
Okay, Lion Guard, head out.

84
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.120
Anga, take the lead.

85
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.790
I'll catch up.

86
00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.210
Got it.

87
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.710
Rani, can we talk?

88
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.920
Of course, Fuli. What's wrong?

89
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.330
Kion doesn't seem
to be getting better.

90
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.710
Well, Nirmala did say his
healing would take time.

91
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.920
But he's even worse
than when he got here.

92
00:04:50.921 --> 00:04:52.830
He's totally
lost his confidence.

93
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.040
Are you sure Nirmala
knows what she's doing?

94
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.380
My grandmother trusted Nirmala

95
00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:00.170
to become the healer
at the Tree of Life.

96
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.170
You should trust her too.

97
00:05:02.171 --> 00:05:05.290
(SIGHS) Okay, if you say so.

98
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:10.540
Is everything okay?

99
00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.380
Fuli doesn't think
Kion's getting better.

100
00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.330
And I think
she might be right.

101
00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.710
This is <i>Pratibimba,
</i> the lake of reflection.

102
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.000
Look in the water.

103
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.120
What do you see?

104
00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.210
Ugh! My scar.

105
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.880
I can't wait till
it's healed and gone.

106
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.080
Kion, what if your scar
never goes away?

107
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.540
But that's the whole
reason I'm here.

108
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.120
To heal my scar.

109
00:05:42.121 --> 00:05:43.790
So I can be my old self again.

110
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.540
That scar doesn't
make you who you are, Kion.

111
00:05:47.541 --> 00:05:48.710
What do you mean?

112
00:05:48.711 --> 00:05:50.750
That scar is only skin deep.

113
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.460
There's much more inside you.

114
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.620
You just need
to remember that.

115
00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:57.960
(YAWNS)

116
00:05:57.961 --> 00:06:00.750
Just like I need
to remember to sleep.

117
00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.120
What? Aren't you gonna
stay here and help me?

118
00:06:04.121 --> 00:06:06.080
I've done everything
I can do, Kion.

119
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.620
To complete your healing,

120
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.960
you need to look
inside yourself.

121
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.500
Look inside myself?

122
00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.250
Yes. Reflect about
what you've done

123
00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.170
and what you have yet to do.

124
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.500
Listen, we have
the perfect opportunity.

125
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.080
Rani's royal duties
are distracting her

126
00:06:27.081 --> 00:06:28.120
from leading the Night Pride.

127
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.210
And Kion doesn't wanna
lead the Lion Guard

128
00:06:31.211 --> 00:06:33.290
because he's afraid
to use the Roar.

129
00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.170
We should attack now.

130
00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.580
Not yet. There's more.

131
00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.960
The Night Pride defends
the Tree of Life at night

132
00:06:41.961 --> 00:06:45.290
and the Lion Guard will be
on duty during the day.

133
00:06:45.291 --> 00:06:47.120
So there's no
good time to attack?

134
00:06:47.121 --> 00:06:50.210
Wrong. We strike
at the end of the shift

135
00:06:50.211 --> 00:06:51.290
when they're tired

136
00:06:51.291 --> 00:06:54.620
and before the new
patrol is on duty.

137
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.040
Sunset. That's
when we'll attack.

138
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.880
Trouble.
Is it Mama Binturong?

139
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:04.420

to push me out of here?

(GRUNTS) No.

146
00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.170
I think we're gonna
push you out of here.

Oh, really, guys?

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

151
00:07:32.541 --> 00:07:34.710
Everyone calm down.

152
00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.380
I said, "Calm down!"

(WHINES)

154
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.040
And who are you?
I'm Fuli.

155
00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:48.960
We are the Lion Guard.

156
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.580
But you're not lions.

157
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.420
Yeah. We get that a lot.

158
00:07:53.421 --> 00:07:55.500
Oh, you're a giant panda.

159
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:57.710
And you guys
are gentle lemurs.

160
00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.380
Not so gentle when
bamboo's at stake.

161
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:02.420
Um, I'm sure we
can work this out.

162
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.330
My name is Beshte.
Who are you?

163
00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:08.620
I am Heng Heng and this is
my favorite bamboo stand.

164
00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.920
I'm Kely and it's our
favorite bamboo stand too.

165
00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.040
Can't you just
come back later?

166
00:08:14.041 --> 00:08:16.170
Uh, no.

167
00:08:16.171 --> 00:08:18.620
Pandas have very
specific requirements

168
00:08:18.621 --> 00:08:19.750
for when we need to eat.

169
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.330
Morning, afternoon,

170
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.380
and the middle of the night.

171
00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.750
Should we just
continue our patrol?

172
00:08:25.751 --> 00:08:26.920
Let them fight it out?

173
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:29.080
I don't think Rani
would like that.

174
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:31.670
So we'll take them to Rani.

175
00:08:31.671 --> 00:08:33.670
She's the Queen.
She'll know what to do.

176
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.170
Right. I'll find her.

177
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.210
All right, everyone,
let's go.

178
00:08:39.211 --> 00:08:41.330
We're gonna go
see the Queen. Now.

179
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:43.880
RANI: Kion?

180
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:46.290
This is your therapy?

181
00:08:46.291 --> 00:08:47.960
Well, yeah.

182
00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:50.960
At least there aren't any
tree frogs jumping on me.

183
00:08:50.961 --> 00:08:51.960
(LAUGHS)

184
00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:53.790
I didn't mean to interrupt.

185
00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.920
It's okay.
I've just been reflecting,

186
00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:00.210
thinking, and I
could use a break.

187
00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:02.750
What have you
been thinking about?
My scar.

188
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:05.540
Nirmala says it might
not ever be totally healed.

189
00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.580
But if it never heals,

190
00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.880
I might not be able
to use the Roar again.

191
00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.500
And without the Roar,

192
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.670
I don't know if I can
lead the Lion Guard.

193
00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:15.750
Do you really need the Roar?

194
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.710
My grandmother said
you were supposed
to come here.

195
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:21.040
That the Roar was
destined to return.

196
00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:24.120
Maybe she meant
the Roar should stay here

197
00:09:24.121 --> 00:09:25.540
even if you leave.

198
00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.170
You're saying
I should give up the Roar?

199
00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:29.580
Leave it behind?

200
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.170
FULI: This way!

201
00:09:31.171 --> 00:09:32.380
Just you wait,

202
00:09:32.381 --> 00:09:34.170
she's gonna say
it's my bamboo.

203
00:09:34.171 --> 00:09:35.290
Oh, no, she won't.

204
00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:36.790
Fuli?

205
00:09:36.791 --> 00:09:38.830
Kely, Heng Heng,
what's going on?

206
00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:41.040
Lemurs, get off of her.

207
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:44.670
Now, what's this about?

208
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.210
Queen Rani,

209
00:09:46.211 --> 00:09:48.210
well, it's just that

210
00:09:48.211 --> 00:09:50.210
Kely and all his friends

211
00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.380
were hogging
the best bamboo stand.

212
00:09:52.381 --> 00:09:53.750
We were there first.

213
00:09:53.751 --> 00:09:55.000
Is that true?

214
00:09:55.001 --> 00:09:56.790
Well, yes, but...

215
00:09:56.791 --> 00:09:58.170
And how long
had you been there?

216
00:09:58.171 --> 00:10:00.420
Well, since sunrise.

217
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:03.000
And when does
Heng Heng have to eat?

218
00:10:03.001 --> 00:10:06.920
ALL: In the morning,
the afternoon and
the middle of the night.

219
00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:08.580
We've already heard this.

220
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:12.670
Kion had a great idea
for the Night Pride
and Lion Guard.

221
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.210
Maybe it'll work for you.

222
00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:15.670
Try taking shifts.

223
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.210
BOTH: Shifts?

224
00:10:17.211 --> 00:10:20.290
The lemurs get the
bamboo stand at sunrise,

225
00:10:20.291 --> 00:10:23.250
then in the middle of the day
and again at sunset.

226
00:10:23.251 --> 00:10:27.330
And, Heng Heng, it's all yours
in the morning, the afternoon

227
00:10:27.331 --> 00:10:29.000
and the middle of the night.
The middle of the night.

228
00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.170
That is a great idea.

229
00:10:31.171 --> 00:10:33.040
Come on, Heng Heng.
My pleasure, Kely.

230
00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:34.620
Let's go, boys.

231
00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:39.210
Hey, Kion, all healed yet?

232
00:10:39.211 --> 00:10:40.880
I don't think so, Bunga.

233
00:10:40.881 --> 00:10:43.620
Maybe the interruptions
are slowing things down.

234
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.040
I'm sorry, Kion.
Fuli's right. We should go.

235
00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.540
Yeah, guess I'll get
back to reflecting.

236
00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:05.170
Fuli, you should know.

237
00:11:05.171 --> 00:11:07.120
I'm worried about
Kion's healing, too.

238
00:11:07.121 --> 00:11:08.120
What do you mean?

239
00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:10.000
We all want him to get better.

240
00:11:10.001 --> 00:11:12.880
But maybe this is as
healed as he's going to get.

241
00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.080
You mean like my eyesight?

242
00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:17.330
It's better, but not
back to the way it was.

243
00:11:17.331 --> 00:11:19.080
Exactly like that, Ono.

244
00:11:19.081 --> 00:11:22.960
If that's true, then
it's time for us to go
back to the Pride Lands.

245
00:11:22.961 --> 00:11:25.250
Except I'm not
sure Kion believes

246
00:11:25.251 --> 00:11:27.420
he can lead the Lion Guard
without the Roar.

247
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.670
Seriously?
Of course, he can.

248
00:11:29.671 --> 00:11:32.170
Kion's always been
leader of the Lion Guard.

249
00:11:32.171 --> 00:11:34.580
Not to mention
our only lion.
Yup.

250
00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.790
Kion might not be
at his best right now,

251
00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:39.670
but he is the best

252
00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:41.540
with or without the Roar.

253
00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:45.080
Maybe you can talk
to him then. (YAWNS)

254
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.120
Sorry. I'm tired.
I'll go get some rest.

255
00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:54.330
Sounds like Kion's doubting
himself more than ever.

256
00:11:54.331 --> 00:11:55.330
Come on.

257
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.580
Done reflecting yet?

258
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.210
Bunga, guys.

259
00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:08.120
I thought you were on patrol.

260
00:12:08.121 --> 00:12:11.210
We are. And we're here
to deal with an emergency.

261
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:13.080
You.
Me?

262
00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:16.460
Kion, you're scar is making
you doubt yourself.

263
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.620
But we don't doubt you.

264
00:12:18.621 --> 00:12:19.960
But without the Roar, I...

265
00:12:19.961 --> 00:12:21.920
You've always been
a great leader, Kion.

266
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.670
Even before you had the Roar.

267
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.960
Wait, Anga, how do you know?

268
00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:28.000
We met you after
Kion got the Roar.

269
00:12:28.001 --> 00:12:31.000
Yeah, but I remember seeing
you around the Pride Lands.

270
00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:35.000
Anga remembers and you
need to remember too.

271
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.250
Remember what makes you you.

272
00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.960
<i>♪ We've come this far together</i>

273
00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:47.380

<i>♪ Remember what

281
00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.830
I remember a time when
we were all a lot younger.

282
00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:29.790
Race you to the watering hole.

283
00:13:29.791 --> 00:13:31.670
The first one there's
a rotten egg.

284
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.790
<i>Zuka Zama!</i>

285
00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.580
(CHUCKLES) Look at me.
I'm the rotten egg!

286
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:43.620
Sorry, Little B,
I got here first.

287
00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:46.880
Guess Beshte is
the rotten egg.

288
00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.080
That's okay.

289
00:13:48.081 --> 00:13:49.380
(FARTS)

290
00:13:49.381 --> 00:13:50.830
I still smell like one.

291
00:13:50.831 --> 00:13:52.540
Kion! Kion!

292
00:13:52.541 --> 00:13:53.620
Fuli?

293
00:13:53.621 --> 00:13:56.250
There's a hyena
in the Pride Lands
and it's stealing an egg.

294
00:13:56.251 --> 00:13:57.960
(GASPS) That's not right.

295
00:13:57.961 --> 00:13:59.460
We gotta go tell your dad.

296
00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:01.120
No time to tell my dad.

297
00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.670
We gotta stop
that hyena ourselves.

298
00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:05.170
Come on.

299
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.500
Hmm.

300
00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:15.080
This egg is so,
oh, hard to roll.

301
00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.420
FULI: Hey, stop!

302
00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.710
Leave that egg alone.

303
00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:22.750
Why are you smiling?

304
00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.290
(LAUGHS)

305
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:27.500
(SINGSONG) 'Cause I know
something you don't know.

306
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:30.580
What's that?
That there's three of us.

307
00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:34.170
Oh, yeah? Well,
there's four of us.

308
00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:37.120
Which is more, three or four?

309
00:14:37.121 --> 00:14:39.210
Give us that egg, hyena.

310
00:14:39.211 --> 00:14:42.540
Hey, he's got a name,
lion cub.

311
00:14:42.541 --> 00:14:46.120
It's Janja.
Yeah, and I am Cheezi.

312
00:14:46.121 --> 00:14:48.620
No, you're Chungu.

313
00:14:48.621 --> 00:14:49.790
I'm Cheezi.

314
00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:51.290
Really?

315
00:14:51.291 --> 00:14:53.290
I don't care who you are.

316
00:14:53.291 --> 00:14:56.040
You hyenas aren't
allowed to steal that egg.

317
00:14:56.041 --> 00:14:58.540
Oh, yeah? Who's gonna stop us?

318
00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:03.380
We are.
Yeah, right.

319
00:15:03.381 --> 00:15:06.040
Come on, fur brains,
help me steal this egg.

320
00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.710
Did he call us fur brains?

321
00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.500
Yeah, I like it.

322
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:12.670
Uh, fur brains,

323
00:15:12.671 --> 00:15:15.750
stop talking and hold
those guys off while
I take the egg.

324
00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.620
Okay, Janja. You got it.

325
00:15:18.621 --> 00:15:20.120
How do we do that?

326
00:15:20.121 --> 00:15:21.460
Beshte, get Cheezi.

329
00:15:25.121 --> 00:15:26.960
Leave that Janja to me.

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:41.040
<i>♪ Remember what makes you you</i>

356
00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:44.580
<i>♪ Recall what is real and true</i>

357
00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:48.790
<i>♪ That's all you need to do</i>

358
00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:54.000
<i>♪ Remember what
makes you you ♪</i>

359
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:57.830
I remember that day.

360
00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.000
Me too.
Oh, yeah.

361
00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.210
I don't.

362
00:17:02.211 --> 00:17:04.080
We sure showed those hyenas.

363
00:17:04.081 --> 00:17:06.880
And you showed us
how to be a team, Kion.

364
00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:09.960
The Roar may have made you
the leader of the Lion Guard,

365
00:17:09.961 --> 00:17:12.040
but it's not what
made you a leader.

366
00:17:12.041 --> 00:17:13.040
You've always been one.

367
00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:14.670
Maybe you're right.

368
00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:18.210
Back then I didn't even
know about the Lion Guard
or the Roar.

369
00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:20.670
Does that mean you're
ready to lead us on patrol?

370
00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:24.170
Actually, it's almost time for
the Night Pride to take over.

371
00:17:24.171 --> 00:17:27.120
(HOOTING)
Lion Guard! Lion Guard!

372
00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:29.620
Makucha, Ora and Chuluun are

373
00:17:29.621 --> 00:17:31.080
headed back up
the mountain pass.

374
00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:33.620
Thanks, Ullu.
Alert the Night Pride.

375
00:17:33.621 --> 00:17:34.920
(HOOTING)

376
00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:40.830
Lion Guard, follow me.

377
00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:49.330
FULI: Kion, they've already
cleared the mountain pass.

378
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:51.790
Then we need
to hurry. Come on.

379
00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:55.120
Here comes the Lion Guard

380
00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:56.880
and they look tired.

381
00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:00.880
So we'll beat them now,
before the Night Pride
gets here.

382
00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:04.040
That's gotta be
Mama Binturong's plan.

383
00:18:04.041 --> 00:18:05.460
Attacking when we're tired.

384
00:18:05.461 --> 00:18:07.750
And before the Night Pride
starts their patrol.

385
00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:11.250
(ROARING)

386
00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:15.830
(YAWNS)

387
00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:20.120
Ow! Kion, I'm down.

388
00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:22.920
Try that on me. I dare ya.

389
00:18:22.921 --> 00:18:23.920
(FARTS)

390
00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.080
Beshte, are you okay?

391
00:18:27.081 --> 00:18:29.080
I'm hurt, but I'll be fine.

392
00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:32.120
Kion, here comes
the Night Pride.

393
00:18:32.121 --> 00:18:33.750
At least most
of the Night Pride.

394
00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:39.380
KION: Surak, Baliyo,
attack Ora from
both sides at once.

395
00:18:39.381 --> 00:18:42.170
Anga, can you take care
of Mama Binturong?

396
00:18:42.171 --> 00:18:43.080
Yup.

397
00:18:43.081 --> 00:18:44.880
Nirmala, with me and Fuli.

398
00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:50.210
(SCREAMS)

399
00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.420
So, Kion can lead.

400
00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
<i>Anga Lenga!</i>
(SCREAMING)

401
00:18:59.001 --> 00:19:00.290
Let me go!

402
00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:04.880
I mean, don't let me go.
(SCREAMS)

403
00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:09.420
It's over. Get out.

404
00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.330
For now.

405
00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:16.750
Not bad.

406
00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:22.120
The venom is
already wearing off.

407
00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:23.750
You'll be fine soon.

408
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:26.250
Thanks, Nirmala.

409
00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:28.040
Great job, everyone.

410
00:19:28.041 --> 00:19:30.000
RANI: Looks like I missed
all the action.

411
00:19:30.001 --> 00:19:32.210
But you handled it
fine without me.

412
00:19:32.211 --> 00:19:34.000
I guess Fuli was right.

413
00:19:34.001 --> 00:19:36.080
You are a great leader, Kion.

414
00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.000
Yeah, but I had forgotten it.

415
00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:42.250
Guess it took
a little reflection.

416
00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:44.710
So, if you're back
to your old self,

417
00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:47.000
does this mean you're ready
to use the Roar again?

418
00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.420
I'm not sure about the Roar.

419
00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.710
Guess I need
to reflect about that too.

420
00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:56.830
(YAWNS) But
tomorrow. I'm tired.

421
00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:05.040
Grandfather Mufasa?

422
00:20:05.041 --> 00:20:06.210
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

423
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.080
I am here, Kion.

424
00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:12.790
Grandfather,

425
00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.040
for the first time
since I got my scar,

426
00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.170
I finally feel like
myself again.

427
00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:19.880
Does that mean you are healed?

428
00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:24.120
Maybe. I know now that my scar
doesn't make me me.

429
00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:26.790
And maybe
the Roar doesn't either.

430
00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:30.170
Queen Janna said the Roar
was supposed
to return to the Tree of Life.

431
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.920
Maybe she meant
I needed to give it back.

432
00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:36.290
You were a great leader
and you didn't have the Roar.

433
00:20:36.291 --> 00:20:38.460
I think I can be a great
leader without it too.

434
00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.380
I'm ready to give it back.

435
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.170
I understand.

436
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:45.210
But you cannot
return the Roar to me.

437
00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:47.790
I never led the Lion Guard.

438
00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.710
The Roar was never mine.

439
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.330
The Roar came from there.

440
00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:56.040
<i>Cikha </i> escarpment.

441
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.250
That is where you must go.

442
00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:06.040
Uh, hello?

443
00:21:06.041 --> 00:21:07.580
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

444
00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:11.120
Greetings, Kion.

445
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:14.250
I am Askari.

446
00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:18.080
Askari. You were leader
of the first Lion Guard.

447
00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:23.500
Yes, and I know you are
leader of the new Lion Guard.

448
00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.330
I am.

449
00:21:25.331 --> 00:21:28.380
And I always thought the Roar
was what made me leader
of the Lion Guard.

450
00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:31.380
And now,
what have you learned?

451
00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:33.080
I've always been a leader.

452
00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:34.830
Even before the Roar.

453
00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:36.380
It's who I am.

454
00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.620
But I'm not sure if I can
control the Roar anymore.

455
00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.880
So, I've come to give it back.

456
00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:43.420
I don't need it.

457
00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:45.040
Good.

458
00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:48.000
That means you are ready.

459
00:21:48.001 --> 00:21:50.710
Ready?
Yes, Kion.

460
00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:53.040
It is time.

461
00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:58.000
Time for you to learn
everything the Roar can do.
