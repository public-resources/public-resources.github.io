to rest and get better.

That's me. That's me.

Amazing to you.
To me? Not so much.

130
00:05:55.371 --> 00:05:59.041
But, they do say that art is
in the eye of the beholder.

131
00:05:59.041 --> 00:06:00.499
You got what in your eye?

132
00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:02.209
"Eye of the beholder."

133
00:06:02.251 --> 00:06:05.751
It means everyone has
their own opinion
of what's good.

134
00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:08.040
Yes. And this painting,

135
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.210
it does not quite have the
spirit of your Lion Guard.

136
00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.379

137
00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.880

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:34.290
Hmm. In my eye,
it is not yet right.

144

taking it easy!

Flying is easy!

not my wings.

I can still help the Guard.

Ono, I really think
you should take a break.

163
00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:25.919
But doesn't the Guard
need me?

164
00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.830
I'm the keenest of sight.

You just need to
get better, Ono.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.169
You'll be back on duty

tastes better,

00:08:12.329 --> 00:08:14.419
ALL: Aye!
Nay!

184
00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:15.670
The ayes have it.

185
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:18.500
Mwoga, you may rejoin
the parliament.

186
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.830
I trust you have a compelling
reason for being late.

187
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:28.499
Indeed. It seems that
Ono of the Lion Guard

188
00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:31.670
is no longer able to see
out of one eye.

189
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:34.830
The keenest of sight
can no longer see?

190
00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:37.879
Hmm. That is interesting.

191
00:08:37.921 --> 00:08:42.041
I suggest we form
a subcommittee to
study the situation.

192
00:08:42.041 --> 00:08:44.580
Capital idea.
Do I hear a second?

193
00:08:46.169 --> 00:08:48.169
(GRUNTS)
Aye!

194
00:08:48.169 --> 00:08:49.499
Very well.

195
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.540
The meeting to nominate
subcommittee members

196
00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:56.380
to study the severity
of Ono's loss of eyesight

197
00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.040
will go to
the planning committee

198
00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.039
for a vote during
the next session.

199
00:09:01.039 --> 00:09:02.709
I feel the need to...

200
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:06.040
Can we go now?
I'm hungry.

201
00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.120
Shh! The vultures
always know

202
00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.120
what's going on
in the Pride Lands.

203
00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.209
And it sounds like
Ono can't see.

204
00:09:13.209 --> 00:09:14.379
(LAUGHS)

205
00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:15.710
Ono can't see!

206
00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:17.420
Yeah! That's great!

207
00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.540
(GASPS)
Uh, why is that great?

208
00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:25.040
Because, fur brain, Ono is
the Guard's eyes in the sky.

209
00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.079
Any time I got
a brilliant plan,

210
00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.790
Ono spots it
and the Guard ruins it.

211
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:32.120
But, if he can't see
anymore...

212
00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.290
(LAUGHS)

213
00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:34.750

And before you ask,

215
00:09:36.579 --> 00:09:38.749
yes, it involves food.

216
00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:43.750
How'd he know we were
thinking about food?

217
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.500
