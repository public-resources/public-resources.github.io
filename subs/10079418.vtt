Ah, there you are!

181
00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.460
Thank goodness.

182
00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:22.329
Zazu?

183
00:08:22.329 --> 00:08:23.709
What are you doing here?

184
00:08:23.709 --> 00:08:26.079
Ono's job, apparently.

185
00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.880
There's been a rockslide.

186
00:08:27.921 --> 00:08:31.871
No one was injured,
but it cut the giraffes off
from their watering hole.

187
00:08:31.871 --> 00:08:33.040
Oh, no.

188
00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.460
(SCOFFS) Oh, yes, Ono.

189
00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.119
<i>Heyvi kabisa!</i>

190
00:08:37.119 --> 00:08:39.419
You would have known
had you been on the lookout.

191
00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:40.420
Oh...

192
00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:42.960
There's nothin'
wrong with him.

193
00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.210
He stands out!

194
00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:45.540
Indeed.

195
00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.169
In any case,
the giraffes need your help.

196
00:08:48.169 --> 00:08:49.789
Right.
We're on it.

197
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:51.500
Till the Pride Lands end...

198
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.460

KION: Ono?

199
00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:55.710
FULI: You coming?

200
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:57.540
Uh, I'm not sure.

201
00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:58.669
You've got to come.

202
00:08:58.669 --> 00:09:00.169
You're the keenest of sight.

203
00:09:00.169 --> 00:09:01.789
Beshte's right, Ono.

204
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:03.420
Come on, we need you.

205
00:09:03.461 --> 00:09:07.421
You heard Kion. Duty calls.
Mustn't dawdle. Spit spot.
Whoa! Okay! Okay!

206
00:09:07.421 --> 00:09:08.420
Lion Guard defend.

207
00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.170
Lion Guard defend!

208
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:13.119
(CHUCKLES) Zazu
can be pretty persuasive.

209
00:09:13.119 --> 00:09:14.459
Definitely.

210
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:15.420
Now let's go!

211
00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.750
At least the giraffes
are all waiting patiently.

212
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:24.749
For now.

213
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.580
Hey!

214
00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.250
Wait your turn, egg-head!

215
00:09:30.291 --> 00:09:32.921
"Egg-head"?
Is that a reference
to how smart I am?

216
00:09:32.921 --> 00:09:37.621
(LAUGHS) No,
it's a reference to your head
looking like an egg!

(LAUGHS)
(GROANS)

218
00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:42.750
Hey, don't call Ono
an egg-head!

219
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:46.080
Yeah! His head
looks more like
a hippo bottom!

221
00:09:48.289 --> 00:09:50.999
Um, thanks, Bunga?

222
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.250
The rocks have
blocked the only way in.

223
00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.380
Hmm.

224
00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.290
BUNGA: Oh, yeah!
This is an easy one.

225
00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:01.539
You can just use the Roar
and blast those rocks away!

226
00:10:01.539 --> 00:10:03.499
Uh, I have a better idea.

227
00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.040
Um... Beshte!

228
00:10:05.081 --> 00:10:08.751
If you move that one big rock,
it'll open up the whole thing.

229
00:10:08.751 --> 00:10:10.670
Hmm... Maybe...

230
00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:12.169
Come on, Kion.

231
00:10:12.169 --> 00:10:13.669
Just use the Roar!

232
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:15.000
Use the Roar!

233
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.540
Use the Roar!

234
00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.040
Use the Roar!

235
00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.750
Bunga,
we're trying this first.

236
00:10:21.669 --> 00:10:22.579
Beshte?

237
00:10:22.579 --> 00:10:24.419
You got it, Kion.

238
00:10:24.419 --> 00:10:26.079
Everybody stand back.

239
00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.290
We don't want
any rocks to hit anybody.

Somehow.

252
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.120
He's a klipspringer!

253
00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.750
Can't he just jump
to the other side?

254
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:10.500
I think the poor little guy's
too scared to move.

255

We'll have to go get him.

256
00:11:13.499 --> 00:11:15.919
The water's moving
too fast for me, Kion.

257
00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.960
And it's too wet for me.

258
00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.250
So just stop the water.

259
00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:21.750
You could do it with the Roar.

260
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:24.120
No, not the Roar.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.749

How come
you didn't just use
the Roar back there?

290
00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:36.499
No reason.

Aw, come on!

After what happened
with my mom, I'm afraid

294

I might hurt someone else
with the Roar.

Say what?

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.709

It's not like you
did that on purpose.

00:12:49.709 --> 00:12:52.709
I know, Bunga.
But that's the problem.

298
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:54.750
I couldn't control it!

299
00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:57.250
I don't know if I should
ever use the Roar again.

300
00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:59.500

Never use the Roar again?

331
00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:21.380
(SIGHS) I shouldn't
use it again.

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:24.420

336
00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:34.960
Janja and the hyenas.

I lost control.

340
00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:43.540
And it almost hurt my mom.

<i>So perhaps you should
speak with the one
you care so much about.</i>

344
00:14:55.251 --> 00:14:56.580
Right.

345
00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:57.960
I will.

about this, Bunga.

about these tail feathers.

Have a seat.
Be with you in a minute.

Whatever.

00:16:38.961 --> 00:16:41.291
Listen!
Makuu and his crocs just
took over the Flood Plains!

380
00:16:41.291 --> 00:16:42.710
He can't do that!

381
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:44.920
A lot of animals
depend on those plains.

382
00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.380
Exactly.
We gotta get down there.

383
00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:50.460
Ono, find Kion,
tell him to meet us
at the Flood Plains.

384
00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:51.499
Affirmative!

385
00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.040
Careful, Ono!

386
00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.880

Now it's time to leave.

your Roar-less leader?

(CHUCKLES) Mighty Kion,

397
00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:36.000
too much of a coward
to use his Roar.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.539
I don't know
what you're
talking about, Makuu.

399
00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:41.460
But if you think
the Lion Guard needs
the Roar to defeat you,

400
00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.960
you're sadly mistaken.

surrounded by hyenas

and it made me so angry.

to use the Roar in anger.

Can you ever forgive me?

Forgive you?
There's nothing to forgive.

You were saving my life.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:22.710

created that earthquake.
And you fell in!

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:24.540
And you helped me out.

Kion, the Roar
is part of who you are.

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:39.379
You can't just stop using it.

444
00:19:39.421 --> 00:19:44.211
But how do you know
I won't use it in anger again
and hurt someone?

445
00:19:44.211 --> 00:19:45.880
Because I know you.
