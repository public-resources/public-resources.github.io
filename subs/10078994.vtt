Hyena in the Pride Lands!

16
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.000
Hyena in the Pride Lands?

17
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.330
All right, hyena!

18
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.619
You picked the wrong day
to come into the Pride Lands!

19
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.580
That's right!

20
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.080
And I'm gonna...

21
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.080
Hey. Bunga.
Wait.

22
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.250
You're not from
Janja's clan.

23
00:01:43.291 --> 00:01:46.621
You're the hyena
that helped Kion when he was
trapped in the Outlands!

24
00:01:46.621 --> 00:01:49.119
(CHUCKLES) Well,
we helped each other out.

25
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.880
Jasiri? What are you doing
in the Pride Lands?

26
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.920
Looking for you.
I have a problem back home.

27
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.540
And I need your help.

28
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.379
Is it Janja and his hyenas?

29
00:01:58.379 --> 00:02:01.539
No.
Actually, it's lions.

30
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.000
Lions?
In the Outlands?

31
00:02:04.041 --> 00:02:07.161
That's right.
They've taken over
my family's watering hole.

32
00:02:07.161 --> 00:02:08.460
And they won't share it.

33
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.959
But there shouldn't be
any lions in the Outlands.

34
00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.209
You sure
they're lions, Jasiri?

35
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.330
(SCOFFS)
I know what lions
look like, Bunga.

36
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.790
Okay. Well, I'd be happy
to talk to them, Jasiri.

37
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.750
Maybe they're lost
or something.

38
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.419
<i>Asante,</i> Kion.
Thank you.

39
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.210
Bunga, go back to the Lair.

40
00:02:26.251 --> 00:02:29.541
Let the rest of the Guard
know I'm going to
the Outlands with Jasiri.

41
00:02:29.541 --> 00:02:31.250
Okay. We'll meet up
with you there.

42
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.710
No need.
I should be right back.

43
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.169
These are lions after all.

44
00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:38.419
It's probably
just a misunderstanding.

45
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.830
Oh, I sure hope so.

46
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.080
Lead the way, Jasiri.

47
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.960
See ya!
Oh, and by the way...

48
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.209
I win! Ha-ha!

49
00:02:52.211 --> 00:02:56.081
You know Kion,
I was kinda worried
you might not help me.

50
00:02:56.081 --> 00:02:57.380
Why wouldn't I?

51
00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.749
We've helped
each other before.

52
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.420
That was different.
Last time the bad guys
were hyenas.

53
00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.330
This time they're lions.

54
00:03:04.371 --> 00:03:08.461
They probably don't realize
there are good hyenas
in the Outlands.

55
00:03:08.461 --> 00:03:10.210
I had that problem
at first, too.

56
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.919
(CHUCKLES) That's true.

57
00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:14.919
It did take a while for us
to trust each other.

58
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.120
(SQUEAKING)
(MOCK GROWLING)

59
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.500
Jasiri, you're back!

60
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.459
Whoa!
You weren't kidding.

61
00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.879
You really are friends
with a lion!

62
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.210
Kion,
this is my sister, Madoa.

63
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:29.620
Nice to meet you, Madoa.

64
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.040
Uh, yeah.
You too.

65
00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:35.879
Hey there, little guys!

66
00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.419
Don't be afraid of me.

67
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.750
You can't blame 'em.
All they know are bad lions.

68
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.380
Like the ones who stole
our watering hole.

69
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.000
Well, that's why I'm here.

70
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.419
I don't know
why those lions
are in the Outlands.

71
00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:49.419
But I'm sure
I can clear things up.

72
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.420
I hope so.
Those little ones
need the water.

73
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.880
We all do.

74
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.540
Then there's
no time to lose.

75
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.500
Let's go, Jasiri!

76
00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.789
...and with all the flooding,
we now have...
Hey, guys. Guys!

77
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.750
You're back just in time.

78
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.710
Ono and Fuli are
about to race!

79
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.380
What? Again?

80
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.460
Affirmative.
But this time,
I'm going to win.

81
00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.169
You say that every time.

82
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.380
Ready?
Ready.

83
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.250
Bunga?
Oh, right.

84
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.380
I'll be the ref!

85
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:21.330
On your marks...

86
00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:23.709
Get set...

87
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.790
Go!

88
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.170
And they're off!

89
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.500
It's Fuli in the lead!

90
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.000
I'm right on your tail, Fuli!

91
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.169
That's what you think.

92
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.380
<i>Huwezi!</i>

93
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.380
Oh, no.

94
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.210
And the winner is...

95
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.880
Fuli!

96
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.329
(PANTING)

97
00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:49.999
Nice race.

98
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.330
Yeah, do it again.

99
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.880
You almost had her
that time.

100
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.500
It was close,
wasn't it?

101
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.120
Hmm.

102
00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.370
Maybe if I flatten
my head feathers
to reduce the drag,

103
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.289
and stay closer
to Fuli's tail

104
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.500
to take advantage
of her slipstream...

105
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.420
Drag?
Slipstream?

106
00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.710
Wha'cha talking about, Ono?

107
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.290
I'm talking about winning!

108
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.790
Lions are pretty reasonable.

109
00:05:14.831 --> 00:05:18.291
Once we get
to the watering hole,
I'm sure we can work things...

110
00:05:18.291 --> 00:05:19.460
(SCREAMS)

111
00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.500
We told you
to stay outta here, hyena!

112
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.619
(YELLS)
Hey!
Back off!

113
00:05:24.619 --> 00:05:25.789
(ROARS)

114
00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.500
Huh! Who are you?
Name's Kion.

115
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.500
Who are you?
Nuka!

116
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.960
Hey, Nuka!

117
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.170
Kovu!

118
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:34.749
Tell him to let me up!

119
00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:36.749
A friend of yours?
(SIGHS)

120
00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:38.459
He's my brother.

121
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.540
That's right!
So you better let me up!

122
00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.120
It's two against one now!

123
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.670
It's two against two.

124
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.829
It should be
three against one!

125
00:05:47.829 --> 00:05:49.499
What kind of lion are you?

126
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.710
Siding with a hyena!

127
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.460
KION: What are you two lions
doing in the Outlands?

128
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.500
Why aren't you
in the Pride Lands?

129
00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.420
Like our family's
welcome there!

130
00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.039
Why wouldn't you be?

131
00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:02.079
I'm sure my dad
would welcome you there.

132
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.580
And who's your dad?

133
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.960
(LAUGHS) You know,
the king of the Pride Lands.

134
00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.290
Simba?

135
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:10.619
BOTH: Simba?

136
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.750
You really think
he'd allow us
into the Pride Lands?

137
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.419
I don't see why not.

138
00:06:14.461 --> 00:06:17.961
Especially if you
give Jasiri's family
their watering hole back.

139
00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:19.670
Back to the Pride Lands.

140
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.380
That means I could
see Kiara again!

141
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.459
You know Kiara?

142
00:06:23.459 --> 00:06:25.879
Yeah!
Uh, it was a while ago.

143
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.460
We gotta take him
to see Mom.

144
00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:28.750
Oh, yeah!

145
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.000
She's gonna want to meet
the son of Simba.

146
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.460
The name's Kion.

147
00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.419
Okay. Kion.

148
00:06:36.209 --> 00:06:37.999
Hyena. Let's go.

149
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.580
C'mon, Jasiri.
You'll see.

150
00:06:41.621 --> 00:06:44.871
This whole watering hole
thing's gotta be
a misunderstanding.

151
00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:51.999
Mother!
We have a visitor!

152
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.380
It's Simba's son. Kion.

153
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.040
Simba's son?

154
00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.500
Well! What an honor.

155
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.329
He pounced on me!
(SIGHS)

156
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.960
I'm sure
you pounced first.

157
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.460
Well, yeah.

158
00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.540
Welcome, Kion.
I'm Zira.

159
00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.959
And this my daughter,
Vitani.

160
00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:14.749
A lion and a hyena?

161
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:16.250
Hmm.

162
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:18.670
Not just any lion, dear.

163
00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:20.420
Simba's son.

164
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.880
So tell me, Kion.

165
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.169
What brings you
to the Outlands?

166
00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:27.539
I did!
We're friends.

167
00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.040
Friends with royalty?

168
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.670
Gracious!
I underestimated you,
my dear.

169
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.249
Kion's not just royalty!

170
00:07:36.249 --> 00:07:38.539
He's leader
of the Lion Guard!

171
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.580
Leader of the Lion Guard?

172
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.790
But the Guard isn't here.

173
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:45.540
No. But I am.

174
00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.579
Now, what are you doing
in the Outlands?

175
00:07:47.579 --> 00:07:50.209
And why have you taken over
Jasiri's watering hole?

176
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:51.620
(SIGHS)

177
00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.420
So many questions, Kion.

178
00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.500
What I don't understand is

179
00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:02.080
why you don't just use
the Roar to give your friend
the water she needs.

180
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.620
What?
You can do that?

181
00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.420
What are you
talking about?
Mom?

182
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.670
As leader of the Lion Guard,

183
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:10.960
Kion possesses
a special power.

184
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.829
The Roar of the Elders.

185
00:08:12.829 --> 00:08:14.879
Isn't that right?

186
00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.500
Yeah. How do you know?

187
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:21.250
Oh, I know
all about the Roar.

188
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.420
You see that little cloud?

189
00:08:24.209 --> 00:08:26.539
Try roaring at it.

190
00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.620
Roar at the cloud?

191
00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.540
What's wrong, Kion?

192
00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.540
I thought you wanted to
help your hyena friend.

193
00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.790
I don't see
how roaring at a cloud
is gonna do that.

194
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:37.749
JASIRI: Kion?

195
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.750
Well, I guess
it won't hurt to try.

196
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.670
(ROARS)

197
00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:54.500
Whoa!

198
00:09:00.619 --> 00:09:03.329
Kion, did you know
you could do that?

199
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.710
No. I didn't.

200
00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:08.920
Zira. How did you know
the Roar could do that?

201
00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.880
Oh. I'd love to tell you.

202
00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:16.620
But I feel
a little uncomfortable
discussing the Roar,

203
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.620
in front of a hyena.

204
00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.460
Oh, don't mind me.

205
00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.670
I just want
my watering hole back!

206
00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:25.669
Perhaps we can go
somewhere more private.

207
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:27.250
And talk...

208
00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:29.620
Lion to lion.

209
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.210
I don't trust her, Kion.

210
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:36.790
I know. But she knows more
about the Roar than I do!

211
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:38.919
Besides, maybe I can
get her to agree

212
00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.120
to share the watering hole.

213
00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.750
I hope you're right.

214
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:44.170
Okay, Zira.
Let's talk.

215
00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:45.790
Wonderful.

216
00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:48.579
Children, I'll be back soon.

217
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.330
(GROWLS)
ZIRA: Play nice, Nuka!

218
00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.750
(CHUCKLES)
That's right, Nuka.

219
00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:01.249
Let's play nice!

220
00:10:01.249 --> 00:10:04.329
Kion.
Son of Simba.

221
00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:05.920
I'm so glad to meet you.

222
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:08.210
You are?

223
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:09.620
Oh, yes!

224
00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:13.330
After all,
it doesn't matter
where we live.

225
00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.379
We're all lions.

226
00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.710
And that's what's important.

227
00:10:17.751 --> 00:10:22.751
<i>♪ There is no greater power

258
00:11:55.621 --> 00:12:00.461
Zira. You and I have
different ideas about
how lions should act.

259
00:12:00.461 --> 00:12:02.499
And that's why we're here.

260
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.120
To talk!

261
00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.420
Whoa!

262
00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:14.040
It may not be Pride Rock,
but we call it home.

263
00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.380
This way.

264
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.380
BUNGA: And here they come!

265
00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:19.750
Heading toward the finish.

266
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:22.080
Fuli wins again!

267
00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.829
Ahhh!

268
00:12:24.999 --> 00:12:27.959
(PANTING)

269
00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.790
Good race, Ono!
You almost got her that time!

270
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:32.000
(GROANS)

271
00:12:34.079 --> 00:12:36.209
Great!
One more run, Ono!

272
00:12:36.209 --> 00:12:38.039
I think you're
wearing her down.

273
00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:45.120
Maybe some other time.

274
00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.000
Beshte!
You wanna give it a go?

275
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.119
I don't think so.

276
00:12:48.119 --> 00:12:50.459
Hey, Rafiki!
You wanna race Fuli?

277
00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.710
Me? Race Fuli?

278
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:55.000
The fastest
in the Pride Lands!

279
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.790
(LAUGHS) Who would be
so foolish to do that, huh?

280
00:12:59.329 --> 00:13:01.999
(GROANS)

281
00:13:01.999 --> 00:13:04.169
Hey! Where is Kion?

282
00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:07.420
Oh, Kion!
That's right.

283
00:13:07.461 --> 00:13:10.921
Kion told me to
tell everyone he's going to
the Outlands with Jasiri.

284
00:13:10.921 --> 00:13:11.879
But he'll be right back.

285
00:13:11.879 --> 00:13:13.289
Why was Jasiri here?

286
00:13:13.289 --> 00:13:15.749
And why'd she take Kion
to the Outlands?

287
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:17.960
She wanted him to talk
to some lions who live there.

288
00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.790
Lions in the Outlands?

289
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:22.380
Yeah, I know.
Weird, right?

290
00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.749
No. No, no!

291
00:13:24.749 --> 00:13:27.039
They are not just any lions.

292
00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.330
They are the Outsiders!

293
00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:30.920
The who?

294
00:13:30.961 --> 00:13:35.791
The Outsiders are
a group of lions led by
a lioness named Zira.

295
00:13:35.791 --> 00:13:38.249
Simba banished them
from the Pride Lands

296
00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:40.830
before any of you
were born.

297
00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:43.170
Why would Simba
banish other lions?

298
00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:45.080
Because Zira and her family,

299
00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:48.540
they were loyal only to Scar.

300
00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:49.789
ALL: Scar?

301
00:13:49.789 --> 00:13:53.289
After Scar was gone,
Simba became King.

302
00:13:53.331 --> 00:13:57.291
But Zira told Simba
he could not rule
the Pride Lands.

303
00:13:57.291 --> 00:14:01.580
Because Scar had chosen
her son Kovu to be king.

304
00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:03.619
But Scar was never
the real King!

305
00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:05.580
Correct, honey badger!

306
00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.500
And that is
what Simba told Zira.

307
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.960
But Zira would not
listen to reason.

308
00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.669
Instead, she attacked Simba!

309
00:14:13.669 --> 00:14:15.669
Of course,
Simba won quickly.

310
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:19.040
But after that,
he had no choice.

311
00:14:19.081 --> 00:14:23.121
He had to banish
Zira and her family
from the Pride Lands.

312
00:14:23.121 --> 00:14:24.619
Forever!

313
00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:27.460
So the lions in the Outlands
might be Zira and her family?

314
00:14:27.461 --> 00:14:31.371
Most definitely.
And if they find out that
Kion is Simba's son,

315
00:14:31.371 --> 00:14:33.080
there could be trouble.

316
00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.790
Much trouble!

317
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:35.919
We gotta help Kion!

318
00:14:35.919 --> 00:14:37.579
Right.
Let's go!

319
00:14:37.579 --> 00:14:39.619
Till the Pride Lands end...

320
00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:41.830
ALL: Lion Guard defend!

321
00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.330
KION: Okay, Zira.
We're alone.

322
00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:46.960
Tell me about the Roar.

323
00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.539
Don't worry, Kion.

324
00:14:48.539 --> 00:14:51.249
I'll tell you all about it.

325
00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:54.000
But first,
you need to tell me.

326
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.040
Whose side are you on?

327
00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.000
Lions?

328
00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.120
Or hyenas?

329
00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.329
I'm on the side
of the Circle of Life.

330
00:15:01.329 --> 00:15:03.289
And the animals
who respect it.

331
00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:05.290
(SIGHS)

332
00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:08.580
You do take after
your father, don't you?

333
00:15:10.121 --> 00:15:14.871
You see, Kion,
I was hoping you'd choose
to side with lions.

334
00:15:14.871 --> 00:15:16.670
With me.

335
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:19.040
But if that's your answer...

336
00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:24.580
Zira?
What's going on?
(GROWLING)

337
00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:26.999
It's your choice, Kion.

338
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.170
With me.
Or against me.

339
00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:32.500
But if you're against me...

340
00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.620
You'll never leave
the Outlands.

341
00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:37.039
Jasiri was right.

342
00:15:37.039 --> 00:15:39.169
She knew not to trust you.

343
00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:41.790
Now tell your lionesses
to back down.

344
00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:43.540
You know I have the Roar.

345
00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:45.290
And you know what it can do.

346
00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:48.040
I used to know
someone else with the Roar.

347
00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:53.580
And when he used it
against his fellow lions,
he lost the Roar.

348
00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:54.920
Forever!

349
00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.710
You're talking about Scar!

350
00:15:56.710 --> 00:16:00.080
That's right.
Scar and I were close.

351
00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.749
Very close.

352
00:16:01.749 --> 00:16:04.289
He taught me
all about the Roar!

353
00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:06.170
If it weren't
for your father,

354
00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:09.170
he'd still be King
of the Pride Lands.

355
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:11.330
Scar was never
the true King!

356
00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.999
How dare you!

357
00:16:13.999 --> 00:16:16.749
Lionesses! Attack!

358
00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:19.880
(GROWLING)

359
00:16:19.921 --> 00:16:25.161
Wait. I'll forgive you
for that little outburst,
Kion.

360
00:16:25.161 --> 00:16:27.209
If you join me.

361
00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:30.960
Think about it
while I fetch my children.

362
00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.500
I want them
to hear your decision.

363
00:16:35.669 --> 00:16:37.669
(GROWLING)

364
00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.040
VITANI: What's taking
Mom so long?

365
00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.080
I don't know.
But I'm tired of waiting!

366
00:16:49.119 --> 00:16:51.579
Nuka, don't start anything!

367
00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.120
Mom said to play nice!

368
00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:56.170
(LAUGHS)
Don't worry, green eyes.

369
00:16:56.211 --> 00:16:59.161
Any game
your brother wants to play,
I can play better!

370
00:16:59.161 --> 00:17:02.959
Oh, I'm not planning
to play at all!

371
00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.170
(GROWLS)
ZIRA: Nuka!

372
00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.210
Mom! You're back!

373
00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:10.710
Mother!
Nothing's happening here.

374
00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:13.290
We're just playing nice!
(SCOFFS)

375
00:17:14.749 --> 00:17:15.879
Where's Kion?

376
00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.920
Kion and I have reached
an agreement.

377
00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.210
And what's that?

378
00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:24.460
We agreed that
the watering hole
belongs to lions.

379
00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.579
Only.
What?

380
00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:29.079
Kion would
never agree to that!

381
00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:31.040
He's a lion, my dear.

382
00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:34.080
And we lions
stick together.

383
00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.040
Now, leave!

384
00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.879
And do not return!

385
00:17:37.879 --> 00:17:39.919
Fine. I'll go.

386
00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:46.000
Keeping me here
doesn't make any sense.

387
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.170
I just want you lions
to share the watering hole!

388
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:52.169
You can tell that to Zira
when she gets back.

389
00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:54.790
I don't think I want to
wait around that long.

390
00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.080
(GROWLING)
(GRUNTING)

391
00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:07.750
Whoa!

392
00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:10.080
Nice try.

393
00:18:10.121 --> 00:18:14.331
Now, why don't we
just wait quietly
for Zira to come back?

394
00:18:14.331 --> 00:18:16.209
(APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS)

395
00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:17.750
(GASPS) Lion Guard!

396
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:19.620
What are you doing here?

397
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.460
I know Kion said
he'd be fine.

398
00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:23.620
But we think
he might be in trouble.

399
00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.669
Do you know where he is?
Yes.

400
00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:28.119
He's joined Zira
and her family.

401
00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.120
ALL: Zira?

402
00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.540
<i>Hapana!</i> Rafiki was right!

403
00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:32.960
You know Zira?

404
00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.120
We've heard about her.

405
00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:37.420
And Kion wouldn't want to be
any part of her family.

406
00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.119
Ugh! I knew it.

407
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.210
I should have
never believed her!

408
00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:43.170
(GROWLING)

409
00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:45.120
ZIRA: Poor Kion.
(KION GASPS)

410
00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.120
So helpless
without his Roar.

411
00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:49.709
Mom? What's going on?

412
00:18:49.709 --> 00:18:51.169
Kion said he'd talk to Simba

413
00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:53.250
about letting us go back
to the Pride Lands!

414
00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:54.750
Why can't we be friends?

415
00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:57.040
This wasn't my choice, Kovu.

416
00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:00.250
He's the one who chose
the hyenas over us.

417
00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:03.619
Aren't we worried
he'll use that Roar on us?

418
00:19:03.661 --> 00:19:08.291
If he uses the Roar
against other lions,
he'll lose it forever.

419
00:19:08.291 --> 00:19:10.250
And if he doesn't
use the Roar...

420
00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:12.960
Well, he'll just lose.

421
00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.749
Either way, we win.

422
00:19:14.749 --> 00:19:17.499
Without the Roar,
Kion is harmless.

423
00:19:17.541 --> 00:19:21.921
Without Kion,
Simba's Pride Lands
are defenseless.

424
00:19:21.921 --> 00:19:23.750
Kion's harmless?

425
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:27.169
(CHUCKLES) You won't
pin me down this time!

426
00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:30.290
(GRUNTS)
(SCREAMS)

427
00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:32.500
Nuka, Nuka, Nuka.

428
00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:35.670
This is your
last chance, Kion.

429
00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:37.329
(GROWLING)

430
00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:45.920
Zira? I do have
something to say.

431
00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.670
Till the Pride Lands end...

432
00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:50.249
LION GUARD:
Lion Guard defend!

433
00:19:50.249 --> 00:19:53.119
JASIRI: (LAUGHING)
Surprise!

434
00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.120
(GROWLS)
Yah!

435
00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:05.330
<i>Twende Kiboko!</i>

436
00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:08.330
Mother! I'm scared!

437
00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:12.120
So...

438
00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:15.379
A Lion Guard
with just one lion.

439
00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.120
Pathetic!

440
00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.330
Stand tall, my lions!

441
00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:23.290
We have this ridiculous
group of animals outnumbered!

442
00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:25.419
Doesn't matter, Zira!

443
00:20:25.419 --> 00:20:28.169
Go ahead, Kion.
Use the Roar!

444
00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:29.920
I... I can't.

445
00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:33.290
That's how Scar
lost the Roar.

446
00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:35.170
He used it against lions.

447
00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:36.290
(RAZZES)

448
00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:37.619
That's not why he lost it!

449
00:20:37.619 --> 00:20:39.709
It was 'cause
he used it for evil!

450
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:41.790
Remember Rafiki's paintings?

451
00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:44.290
Of course.
You're right!

452
00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:48.250
No! That's not true.

453
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:50.289
I know the Roar's powers.

454
00:20:50.289 --> 00:20:51.959
Listen to me, Kion...

455
00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.290
Oh, I've listened
to you, Zira.

456
00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:56.040
Now, you listen to me.

457
00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:57.710
As long as I'm around,

458
00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:00.460
you're not welcome
in the Pride Lands.

459
00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:02.119
Or the Outlands!

460
00:21:02.119 --> 00:21:04.329
You... You wouldn't!

461
00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:05.710
We're lions!

462
00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:08.290
(ROARS)

463
00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:12.210
(ALL SCREAMING)

464
00:21:14.709 --> 00:21:16.289
Mom! Mom!

465
00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:17.540
Wait for me!

466
00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:20.540
(ALL SCREAMING)

467
00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:23.620
Huh. Where are we?

468
00:21:24.289 --> 00:21:26.499
Our new home.

469
00:21:27.329 --> 00:21:29.419
I know Jasiri
believed in you.

470
00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:32.170
But I'll admit,
I had my doubts.

471
00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:33.380
And now?

472
00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.500
I'm glad she has you
for a friend.

473
00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.329
Thanks. Me, too.

474
00:21:37.329 --> 00:21:39.879
I'm glad to have
all of you as friends.

475
00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:41.830
Back at ya, Jasiri.

476
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:44.500
(BARKING)

477
00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:46.040
Hey, little ones!

478
00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.710
I'm not so scary now, huh?

479
00:21:49.499 --> 00:21:50.959
(YELPING)

480
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:53.290
(LAUGHING)

481
00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:55.920
Oh, well...
Take it as a compliment.

482
00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.580
You are pretty fierce.
