Near the big tree.

363
00:16:46.171 --> 00:16:47.420
Must be a tree well.

364
00:16:47.421 --> 00:16:48.460
I've heard of those.

365
00:16:48.461 --> 00:16:51.170
Loose snow under a tree
that you can fall into.

366
00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.080
Don't worry, Little B.
We'll get you out.

367
00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:58.210
Uh... Uh-oh.

368
00:16:58.211 --> 00:16:59.330
Beshte, get back!

369
00:16:59.331 --> 00:17:01.420
(GRUNTING)

370
00:17:01.421 --> 00:17:04.120
It's snowing.

371
00:17:04.121 --> 00:17:07.290
(GARBLED) Hey!
Catch a snowflake
on your tongue! It's fun!

372
00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.290
(WITH EFFORT)
No, thank you.

373
00:17:09.291 --> 00:17:10.330
Whew!

374
00:17:10.331 --> 00:17:11.040
We need to be careful.

375
00:17:11.041 --> 00:17:15.210
The snow around the tree well
could bury them
if we get too close.

376
00:17:15.211 --> 00:17:16.380
Can they climb out?

377
00:17:16.381 --> 00:17:19.290
No. If they move at all,
they might fall in deeper.

378
00:17:19.291 --> 00:17:21.380
(GASPS)
They can't move at all?

379
00:17:21.381 --> 00:17:23.120
Somebody should tell them!

380
00:17:23.121 --> 00:17:26.540
Bunga! Snow monkeys!
Ono says don't move around!

381
00:17:26.541 --> 00:17:28.290
Did she say,
"Move around?"

382
00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:32.210
Okay. Everybody move around.

383
00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:34.330
(ALL SCREAMING)

384
00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:37.500
Bunga! Monkeys!

385
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:39.540
We're okay!

386
00:17:39.541 --> 00:17:41.380
Much better, in fact.

387
00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:45.170
So, if we can't
get close to them...

388
00:17:45.171 --> 00:17:47.420
And they can't
climb up to us...

389
00:17:47.421 --> 00:17:49.120
How are we gonna get them out?

390
00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:51.080
(GRUNTS SOFTLY)

391
00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:56.250
I... I don't know.

392
00:17:56.251 --> 00:17:59.500
Fuli, what do you
think we should do?

393
00:17:59.501 --> 00:18:02.120
Me? It's not up to me.

394
00:18:02.121 --> 00:18:03.540
You're the leader
of the Lion Guard.

395
00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:05.210
You know what you're doing.

396
00:18:05.211 --> 00:18:07.080
Not today, I don't.

397
00:18:07.081 --> 00:18:08.210
You were right.

398
00:18:08.211 --> 00:18:11.380
I can't think clearly
when my scar is bugging me.

399
00:18:11.381 --> 00:18:14.170
I can't trust
myself right now.

400
00:18:14.171 --> 00:18:16.120
But I know I can trust you.

401
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.170
You make the call.

402
00:18:18.171 --> 00:18:19.210
What should we do, Fuli?

403
00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:22.540
Um... Ugh.

404
00:18:22.541 --> 00:18:25.120
Wait. Right.

405
00:18:25.121 --> 00:18:27.460
Ono. Could you fly over
the hole and pull them out?

406
00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:29.460
Theoretically, yes.

407
00:18:29.461 --> 00:18:30.580
Though, I couldn't lift them.

408
00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:33.170
But Anga could.

409
00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:34.620
Me? No way.

410
00:18:34.621 --> 00:18:36.540
It's the only way.

411
00:18:36.541 --> 00:18:38.290
Just fly down the hole,

412
00:18:38.291 --> 00:18:40.540
grab Bunga
and the snow monkeys,
and bring 'em out.

413
00:18:40.541 --> 00:18:41.080
Sounds like a plan.

414
00:18:41.081 --> 00:18:44.540
But don't touch the walls,
and don't let them move.

415
00:18:44.541 --> 00:18:45.120
Don't let 'em move?

416
00:18:45.121 --> 00:18:48.500
Those snow monkeys panic like
zebras every time they see me.

417
00:18:48.501 --> 00:18:50.460
They won't, if they know
you're a friend.

418
00:18:50.461 --> 00:18:53.420
I found 'em a new home.
What more do I have to do?

419
00:18:53.421 --> 00:18:55.460
Well, you could try smiling.

420
00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:57.620
Okay.

421
00:18:57.621 --> 00:19:01.250
How's this?

422
00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:04.540
It's... <i> Poa.</i>

423
00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.420
Okay, I'll do it.

424
00:19:07.421 --> 00:19:09.330
(SNOW MONKEYS COUGHING)

425
00:19:09.331 --> 00:19:11.330
Yeah. That's me.

(SNOW MONKEYS SCREAM)

427
00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:16.670
Oh, hey, Anga. What's up?

428
00:19:16.671 --> 00:19:18.330
I'm getting you out of there.

429
00:19:18.331 --> 00:19:18.920
(SNOW MONKEYS GASP)

430
00:19:18.921 --> 00:19:22.170
Just don't move, or you'll
make the hole deeper. Got it?

431
00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:25.580
Now, I'm gonna grab
you with my talons...

432
00:19:25.581 --> 00:19:27.250
Your talons?

433
00:19:27.251 --> 00:19:29.500
Yeah, and lift you out
one at a time.

434
00:19:29.501 --> 00:19:31.500
But you've gotta
trust me, okay?

435
00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:33.580
I trust you.

436
00:19:33.581 --> 00:19:35.580
Uh, me too.

437
00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:39.500
I guess we all do.

438
00:19:39.501 --> 00:19:42.290
Okay, here I come.

439
00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:45.330
Okay, snow monkey on top,

440
00:19:45.331 --> 00:19:47.170
get ready to grab my talons.

441
00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:49.710
They're... Sharp.

carrying all of you

at once, but whatever.

448
00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:10.330
Miss me?

Sorry I moved,

but you're the first
giant bird we've
ever met who's nice.

453
00:20:19.621 --> 00:20:21.620
Thanks. Oh.

454

Thank you, everyone.

455

But...

456
00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:28.580
Do we have to go back to
the place with all the trees?

457
00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:30.290
Well...

458
00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.710
Fuli, what do you think?

459
00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:37.540
I think Anga can find a place
that's really right for them.

460
00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:42.330
And some Tuliza for you.

461
00:20:42.331 --> 00:20:43.670
I like how you think.

462
00:20:43.671 --> 00:20:46.420
Anga, a new place
for your new friends?

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:47.710
Yup.

Ah. This is the life.

You said it, Little B.

Uh-huh.

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:11.500

I'll be okay.

Mmm. Thanks, Anga.

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:27.380
Better already.

00:21:27.381 --> 00:21:29.790
And I think I found the next

Just around that slope.

we need to get going?

What do you think?
