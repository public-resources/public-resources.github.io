to the waterfall?

00:01:09.041 --> 00:01:10.040
Not far.

Just up ahead.

the <i>moja kwa moja </i> stone.

are on the right path

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.580
<i>the Back Lands waterfall
is the first landmark
after Pride Rock.</i>

13
00:01:29.581 --> 00:01:31.920
Right. Anga, lead the way!

14
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.290
Oh! That sure looks like
a <i>moja kwa moja </i> stone.

we need to find a tree.

Hmm.

Aw. If only I could see.

Come on, Ono.
You can still see.

29

Do you know what
an iroko tree looks like?

34
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.120
Yep. And I'll see
if I can find it.

There!

38
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.830
Found it.
Pretty far away though.

39

Wow. Good thing
we have you, Ono.

41
00:02:46.121 --> 00:02:48.420
Yeah. You might not
be the keenest of sight,

42
00:02:48.421 --> 00:02:50.000
but you're still bright.

43
00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:51.170

to the Tree of Life

our best chance.

00:08:54.961 --> 00:08:58.330
Come on, Fuli. If it's a trap,
you know we can handle 'em.

190

not the other way around.

199
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:26.040
But you still do, Ono.

200
00:09:26.041 --> 00:09:29.120
You helped us get
to safety when you
heard the harmattan coming.

201
00:09:29.121 --> 00:09:30.380
Now, come on.

202

you better run.

saved you?

Maybe he's not
as bad as I thought.

218
00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.170
Maybe he really is just
trying to help us out
of his territory.

219
00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:47.000
You actually
saved the lion?

It's not like I meant to.

221
00:10:48.381 --> 00:10:50.790
I was saving myself,
and he got in the way.

222
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:54.620
Sounds like the winds
are dying down again.

223
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:04.080
Yep, and it's a good thing.

We still have
a long way to go.

225

The eagle's right. Let's go.

226
00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:14.120
Stick with me, and I'll
get you out of my
territory in no time.

227
00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:16.000
And the sooner the better.

228

229
00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:23.710

Yes.

ever stop talking?

MAKINI: Wait till you see
all the animals there.

234
00:11:34.291 --> 00:11:37.620
The rarest animals from
everywhere live there.

235
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:40.920
Did she say "rare animals"?

236
00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:44.790
So many animals
from all over go to the
Tree of Life to be safe.

237

And it's so hard to find.

to ditch them? (CHUCKLES)

Oh. We're gonna do
more than that.

how to get there.
