00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:15.000
The Tree of Life
is huge!

5
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:17.170
Yes, it is.
Now, follow me.

7
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.460
Grandmother. As requested,

8
00:01:31.461 --> 00:01:33.750
I have brought Kion
and the Lion Guard.

9
00:01:33.751 --> 00:01:36.670
Lion Guard?
This is Queen Janna,

10
00:01:36.671 --> 00:01:38.880
Guardian of
the Tree of Life.

11
00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:40.540
Be welcome here.

12
00:01:40.541 --> 00:01:42.620
Thank you,
Your Majesty.

13
00:01:42.621 --> 00:01:45.210
My friend Ono and I
have come
to be healed.

14
00:01:45.211 --> 00:01:47.620
Step closer,
Kion and Ono.

15
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.830
You have
the Mark of the Guard.

16
00:01:51.831 --> 00:01:54.040
You are from
the Pride Lands then?

17
00:01:54.041 --> 00:01:57.000
Uh, yeah.
Indeed.

18
00:01:57.001 --> 00:02:00.500
And so, the Roar
has returned.

19
00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:02.040
KION: You know
about the Roar?

20
00:02:02.041 --> 00:02:03.540
Of course, Kion.

21
00:02:03.541 --> 00:02:06.080
I take it that
Rafiki sent you here?

22
00:02:06.081 --> 00:02:08.290
Yes. Ono's eyes are hurt.

23
00:02:08.291 --> 00:02:10.000
And my scar...

24
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.120
I can't control the Roar.

25
00:02:12.121 --> 00:02:14.330
So, I have heard. Nirmala?

26
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.210
Nirmala is a fierce warrior.

27
00:02:18.211 --> 00:02:20.080
But she is also
a gentle healer.

28
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.670
(WHISPERING)

29
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.290
Ono, healing your sight
will be simple.

30
00:02:33.291 --> 00:02:36.080
But the remedy will take
a few days to prepare.

31
00:02:36.081 --> 00:02:38.330
Thank you,
Your Majesty.

32
00:02:38.331 --> 00:02:42.000
Kion? Your ailments
are more complicated.

33
00:02:42.001 --> 00:02:44.210
It is more than just a scar.

34
00:02:44.211 --> 00:02:46.000
Your healing
will take time.

35
00:02:46.001 --> 00:02:47.790
And patience.

36
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.790
Then I'd like to start
right away.

37
00:02:49.791 --> 00:02:51.830
I'm sure you would.
Nirmala?

38
00:02:51.831 --> 00:02:52.960
We'll begin today.

39
00:02:52.961 --> 00:02:54.420
Thank you,
Your Majesty.

40
00:02:54.421 --> 00:02:56.120
This way, Kion.

41
00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.170
Rani? Please show
our other guests around.

42
00:03:01.171 --> 00:03:04.080
Show them around?
But I...

43
00:03:04.081 --> 00:03:07.170
Baliyo and Surak can handle
the Night Pride's duties
for now.

44
00:03:07.171 --> 00:03:09.460
You must continue
to take on the duties

45
00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:10.920
that I cannot perform.

46
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.210
(SIGHS)
Yes. Of course.

47
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.880
Follow me.

48
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.170
Little Makini.
Please stay.

49
00:03:22.171 --> 00:03:23.710
You remember me?

50
00:03:23.711 --> 00:03:25.000
Of course.

51
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:26.380
Though you were
much smaller

52
00:03:26.381 --> 00:03:29.080
when you and your parents
came here to meet Rafiki.

53
00:03:29.081 --> 00:03:30.170
(SCREAMS) Yes!

54
00:03:30.171 --> 00:03:33.540
This is where Rafiki said
I'd be a Royal Mjuzi someday!

55
00:03:33.541 --> 00:03:35.040
He started my training!

56
00:03:35.041 --> 00:03:38.080
And we will continue
your training here,
if you'd like.

57
00:03:38.081 --> 00:03:40.960
(GASPS) I'd be honored!

NIRMALA: This is <i>Dirisha.</i>

The River of Patience.

60
00:03:46.081 --> 00:03:48.380
And this is where
you'll heal my scar?

61
00:03:48.381 --> 00:03:50.000
So I can control the Roar?

62
00:03:50.001 --> 00:03:52.000
This is the first
of many steps

63
00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:53.620
on your journey
to healing.

64
00:03:53.621 --> 00:03:55.420
How long's it gonna take?

65
00:03:55.421 --> 00:03:56.920
That depends on you.

66
00:03:56.921 --> 00:03:59.580
As Queen Janna said,
you must have patience.

67
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.170
Look at the top
of that ridge.

68
00:04:02.171 --> 00:04:04.380
Do you see
the bright orange flower?

69
00:04:04.381 --> 00:04:05.500
KION: Yeah?

70
00:04:05.501 --> 00:04:07.580
I need you
to bring it to me.

71
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.210
I'll be right back.

72
00:04:10.211 --> 00:04:13.000
Easy, Kion.
<i>Arama karo.</i>

73
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:15.000
You need to follow
my instructions.

74
00:04:15.001 --> 00:04:18.000
First, you'll need to wait
for a log to float past.

75
00:04:18.001 --> 00:04:21.000
Hop onto the log,
and ride it down the river.

76
00:04:21.001 --> 00:04:24.210
Once you reach that
sandy bank, jump off.

77
00:04:24.211 --> 00:04:27.580
Then take the winding path
up to the top of the ridge.

78
00:04:27.581 --> 00:04:30.380
Wouldn't it be faster
just to swim
across the river?

79
00:04:30.381 --> 00:04:32.830
Then climb the ridge
to get to the flower?

80
00:04:32.831 --> 00:04:36.880
Possibly. But the fast way
isn't always the best way.

81
00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:38.830
Where have I heard
that before?

82
00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.460
(SIGHS) Okay.

83
00:04:41.461 --> 00:04:43.120
I'll try it your way.

84
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.170
So where are the logs?

85
00:04:47.171 --> 00:04:48.460
One will come.

86
00:04:48.461 --> 00:04:51.080
Yeah, but how long
is that gonna take?

87
00:04:51.081 --> 00:04:52.420
It could be days!

88
00:04:52.421 --> 00:04:54.620
Then we wait for days.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.250
BUNGA: Why are you
just sitting here?

182
00:09:18.251 --> 00:09:20.040
I'm waiting for a log.

183
00:09:20.041 --> 00:09:21.330
Sounds fun.

184
00:09:21.331 --> 00:09:23.170
Ooh, yeah! It does!

185
00:09:23.171 --> 00:09:24.040
It's really not.

186
00:09:24.041 --> 00:09:25.250
Something's going on.

187
00:09:25.251 --> 00:09:28.330
That owl came to get Rani,
and she just ran off.

188
00:09:28.331 --> 00:09:30.120
Think they could use
some help?

189
00:09:30.121 --> 00:09:32.120
They might. Come on!

190
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.540
Wait! I didn't get
to see a log!

191
00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:37.920
Take your best shot!

192
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:40.040

193
00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:41.880
(SCOFFS)

194
00:09:41.881 --> 00:09:43.250
Not bad.

195
00:09:43.251 --> 00:09:45.830
(PANTING)
Whose side are you on?

196
00:09:45.831 --> 00:09:49.210
My side, Makucha!
Always!

197
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.170
(LOW GROWLING)

198
00:09:52.171 --> 00:09:53.380

200
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.670
(GASPS)

201
00:09:56.671 --> 00:09:57.790
Get out!

202
00:09:57.791 --> 00:09:58.830
(GRUNTS)

203
00:09:58.831 --> 00:09:59.830
No!

204
00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:03.960
Now leave!
And never come back!

205
00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.330
Well done, Night Pride.

206
00:10:08.331 --> 00:10:10.170
<i>Heyvi kabisa!</i>

207
00:10:10.171 --> 00:10:12.210
(GRUNTING)

208
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:16.250
Kion? Lion Guard?
What are you
doing here?

209
00:10:16.251 --> 00:10:17.920
We came to help?

210
00:10:17.921 --> 00:10:19.000
That's right!

211
00:10:19.001 --> 00:10:21.000
Where are the bad guys?
Let me at 'em!

212
00:10:21.001 --> 00:10:22.120
They're gone.

213
00:10:22.121 --> 00:10:24.290
Defending the Tree of Life
is our job.

214
00:10:24.291 --> 00:10:25.380
And we're good at it.

215
00:10:25.381 --> 00:10:26.960
But...
We don't need your help.

216
00:10:26.961 --> 00:10:29.500
You came for healing.
So stay out of our way,

217
00:10:29.501 --> 00:10:31.120
get healed, and go home.

218
00:10:31.121 --> 00:10:33.210
Besides, it was just
two leopards

219
00:10:33.211 --> 00:10:35.330
and a Komodo dragon.
No big deal.

220
00:10:35.331 --> 00:10:38.380
Two leopards?
And a Komodo dragon?

221
00:10:38.381 --> 00:10:41.000
They didn't even seem
to like each other
very much.

222
00:10:41.001 --> 00:10:42.580
True. Perhaps that is why

223
00:10:42.581 --> 00:10:44.000
they didn't fight
well together.

224
00:10:44.001 --> 00:10:46.170
I don't know.
That big leopard,

225
00:10:46.171 --> 00:10:47.880
Makucha?
He fought pretty good.

226
00:10:47.881 --> 00:10:50.040
Makucha?
What?

227
00:10:50.041 --> 00:10:51.420
We know Makucha.

228
00:10:51.421 --> 00:10:53.000
And probably
the other two.

229
00:10:53.001 --> 00:10:54.460
They must have
followed us here.

230
00:10:54.461 --> 00:10:55.920
They followed you?

231
00:10:55.921 --> 00:10:59.210
I'm really sorry.
This is all our fault.

232
00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.330
QUEEN JANNA:
And that is Askari,

233
00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:08.420
when he first discovered
the Roar of the Elders.

234
00:11:08.421 --> 00:11:11.040
I'm glad
you are here, Makini.

235
00:11:11.041 --> 00:11:14.000
It's been some time since
we've had a Royal Mjuzi.

236
00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:16.500
That bakora staff was hers.

237
00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:20.080
Before she completed
her journey on
the Circle of Life.

238
00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:24.080
Oh! It's beautiful.

239
00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.960
If you like it,
it's yours now.

240
00:11:26.961 --> 00:11:29.210
Really?
RANI: Grandmother!

241
00:11:29.211 --> 00:11:31.460
Rani?
Is something wrong?

242
00:11:31.461 --> 00:11:32.880
You could say that.

243
00:11:32.881 --> 00:11:35.080
Kion led an army
of predators here!

244
00:11:35.081 --> 00:11:36.880
An army
of predators?

245
00:11:36.881 --> 00:11:39.210
I wouldn't call three
an army.

246
00:11:39.211 --> 00:11:41.170
We never should have
let him in.

247
00:11:41.171 --> 00:11:43.420
I am sorry, Your Majesty.

248
00:11:43.421 --> 00:11:45.920
I had no idea
they were following us.

249
00:11:45.921 --> 00:11:47.790
I doubt they will leave
now that

250
00:11:47.791 --> 00:11:49.620
they have found
the Tree of Life.

251
00:11:49.621 --> 00:11:51.420
At least let me
and the Lion Guard help

252
00:11:51.421 --> 00:11:52.920
with Makucha and...
RANI: No!

253
00:11:52.921 --> 00:11:55.000
I told you!
We can handle it!

254
00:11:55.001 --> 00:11:58.210
Rani?
Sorry, Grandmother.

255
00:11:58.211 --> 00:12:00.580
Thank you for
your offer, Kion.

256
00:12:00.581 --> 00:12:02.210
But Rani is correct.

257
00:12:02.211 --> 00:12:03.710
It is the Night Pride's duty

258
00:12:03.711 --> 00:12:05.580
to protect the Tree of Life.

259
00:12:05.581 --> 00:12:06.960
Yeah, but it's
my fault that...

260
00:12:06.961 --> 00:12:08.960
Kion. You must
help yourself

261
00:12:08.961 --> 00:12:11.040
before you can
help others.

262
00:12:11.041 --> 00:12:13.960
Now go.
And let Nirmala guide you.

263
00:12:13.961 --> 00:12:17.080
After all, that is why
you have come
to the Tree of Life.

264
00:12:17.081 --> 00:12:20.460
(SIGHS) Yes, Your Majesty.

265
00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:26.540
Still no log. (SIGHS)

266
00:12:26.541 --> 00:12:29.790
Nirmala, if you'd let me
do it my way,

267
00:12:29.791 --> 00:12:32.210
I'd have that flower
and be back by now!

268
00:12:32.211 --> 00:12:33.790
Let me guide you, Kion.

269
00:12:33.791 --> 00:12:35.330
Like Queen Janna said.

270
00:12:35.331 --> 00:12:36.830
Argh...

271
00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:40.380
Yes!

272
00:12:40.381 --> 00:12:41.460
Patience, Kion.

273
00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:53.460
Forget it! This time
I'm doing it my way!

274
00:12:53.461 --> 00:12:54.920
If you must.

275
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.250
Whoa. This current
is stronger than it looked.

276
00:13:10.251 --> 00:13:12.920

NIRMALA:
This way, Kion!

280
00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:29.080
Follow me!

281
00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.170
Straight up the slope
looks faster to me.

282
00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:39.380
Whoa.

283
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:44.040
(GRUNTING)

284
00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:48.080
Almost there...

285
00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.420
How's that going
for you?

286
00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:54.380
It's going just...

287
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:58.000
Fine!

288
00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:01.040
(GROANS)

289
00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.540
Where's the flower?

290
00:14:05.541 --> 00:14:07.500
Why didn't you get it
while you were up there?

291
00:14:07.501 --> 00:14:09.170
That is your task, Kion.

292
00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:11.040
It's almost night.

293
00:14:11.041 --> 00:14:13.290
You should get some sleep
while I go on patrol.

294
00:14:13.291 --> 00:14:15.920
Tomorrow is
a very important day.

295
00:14:15.921 --> 00:14:17.830
Yeah? What's gonna
happen tomorrow?

296
00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:21.250
Tomorrow you're going
to try again.

297
00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:25.210
(SIGHS) "Try again.
Try again."

298
00:14:25.211 --> 00:14:27.040
That's all
Nirmala ever says!

299
00:14:27.041 --> 00:14:28.330
Ugh!

300
00:14:28.331 --> 00:14:31.250
But how is falling
into a river
supposed to heal me?

301
00:14:31.251 --> 00:14:32.710
Sounds like fun
to me!

302
00:14:32.711 --> 00:14:34.580
I'm sure tomorrow
will be better.

303
00:14:34.581 --> 00:14:37.880
Kion, you can do anything
you put your mind to.

304
00:14:37.881 --> 00:14:39.670
Yeah! You're Kion!

305
00:14:39.671 --> 00:14:41.210
Leader of the Lion Guard!

306
00:14:41.211 --> 00:14:42.420
You never give up.

307
00:14:42.421 --> 00:14:43.750
Bunga's right.
Yep.

308
00:14:43.751 --> 00:14:44.790
Indeed.

309
00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:49.170
Okay. I'll try again
tomorrow.

310
00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.120
Is Kion healed yet?

311
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.040
Rani. You sound
just like him.

312
00:14:56.041 --> 00:14:57.330
It's going to take time.

313
00:14:57.331 --> 00:14:59.580
I hope it doesn't take
too long.

314
00:14:59.581 --> 00:15:02.420
Kion and the Lion Guard
are nothing but trouble.

315
00:15:02.421 --> 00:15:05.250
Speaking of trouble,
look who's back.

316
00:15:05.251 --> 00:15:07.580
They're trying to sneak up
in the dark?

317
00:15:07.581 --> 00:15:10.120
What part of Night Pride
didn't they understand?

318
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:17.170
Ora! Pick your tail up!

319
00:15:17.171 --> 00:15:20.210
My plan is to sneak in
under cover of darkness.

320
00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:23.580
They won't see us.
But they might hear us!

321
00:15:23.581 --> 00:15:26.250
Nah! We saw you too.
What?

322
00:15:26.251 --> 00:15:28.500
We're the Night Pride.

Great plan, Chuluun.

327
00:15:47.081 --> 00:15:49.540
Let's attack
the Night Pride at night.

Yes! Enough
sneaking around!

Next time we will do it
the dragon way!

Go in fast, go in mean,

331
00:15:59.461 --> 00:16:02.210

Excellent.

335
00:16:12.121 --> 00:16:14.290
And it looks like
I got here just in time.

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:25.170
Well done!

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:34.880

are attacking again!

Let me help kick them out!

You're the one
in need of help, Kion.
Remember?

Stay focused
and finish your task.

No matter what!

349
00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.960
(SIGHS) Stay focused...

350
00:17:02.961 --> 00:17:04.000
Finish the task.

They're trying
to go around us!

00:17:24.751 --> 00:17:25.880
Come on.

361
00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:37.000
Dead end.

362
00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:43.420
Now we do it my way.

363
00:17:43.421 --> 00:17:45.920
We stand and fight!

364
00:17:45.921 --> 00:17:47.330
You do it your way.

365
00:17:47.331 --> 00:17:48.960
I'll do it mine!

366
00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:52.000
(GROWLING)

367
00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:06.000
Surak! Look out!

368
00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.420
(GROWLING)

369
00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:12.330
Nice move.

370
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:15.830
Guys, I'm down.

371
00:18:15.831 --> 00:18:18.000
Hey. That's my little brother
you bit!

372
00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.290
(BOTH GRUNTING)

373
00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:26.080
Nice work, Ora.

374
00:18:26.081 --> 00:18:28.210
Now it's three
against three.

375
00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:32.830
Made it.
Now where's that flower?

376
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.380
(RANI SCREAMS)

377
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.080
<i>Heyvi kabisa!</i>

378
00:18:42.081 --> 00:18:43.330
The Night Pride.

379
00:18:43.331 --> 00:18:44.920
And Baliyo's down.

380
00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:50.580
Nirmala said to finish
the task.

381
00:18:50.581 --> 00:18:52.120
No matter what.

382
00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.080
But now I can help!

383
00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:02.080
(ALL GROWLING)

384
00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:07.960
Baliyo.

385
00:19:07.961 --> 00:19:09.170
(GROWLS)

386
00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:11.580
Kion!

387
00:19:11.581 --> 00:19:13.710
Kion?
Kion?

388
00:19:13.711 --> 00:19:15.080
Use your Roar thingy!

389
00:19:15.081 --> 00:19:16.500
Send those guys flying!

390
00:19:16.501 --> 00:19:18.000
The Roar? Forget it!

391
00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:22.000
I do not want to get hit
with that Roar again!

392
00:19:22.001 --> 00:19:24.000
Some "leader"
he turned out to be.

393
00:19:24.001 --> 00:19:26.210
Forget him.
Forget attacking.

394
00:19:26.211 --> 00:19:27.580
Kion came down that hill.

395
00:19:27.581 --> 00:19:30.500
So the Tree of Life must be
on the other side.

396
00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:34.170
(BOTH GROWLING)

397
00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:36.000
Surak. Follow Ora.

398
00:19:36.001 --> 00:19:37.750
Make sure he doesn't
double back.

399
00:19:37.751 --> 00:19:38.880
Understood.

400
00:19:38.881 --> 00:19:41.380
Nirmala, get Baliyo
somewhere safe.

401
00:19:41.381 --> 00:19:42.880
Kion, you're with me.

402
00:19:42.881 --> 00:19:45.170
We have to stop them
from getting over that ridge!

403
00:19:45.171 --> 00:19:46.210
Okay.

404
00:19:46.211 --> 00:19:48.040
Kion! The path!

405
00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.210
Let Nirmala guide me...

406
00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.040
(PANTING)
I hope I get there in time...

407
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.080
What? Kion!

408
00:20:07.081 --> 00:20:08.330
Surprise, Makucha!

409
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:10.120
(GRUNTING)

410
00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.080
Watch it!

411
00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.210
(LAUGHING)

412
00:20:15.211 --> 00:20:16.460
You missed!

413
00:20:16.461 --> 00:20:17.960
RANI: I won't!

414
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.210
Whoa!

415
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:24.460
Nice.
You too.

416
00:20:24.461 --> 00:20:26.670
Now let's make sure
they keep going.

417
00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.620
This way!

418
00:20:29.621 --> 00:20:32.250
Don't tell me we missed
the battle again!

419
00:20:32.251 --> 00:20:33.750
Nope. Look.

420
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:36.880
Ugh! The Lion Guard?

421
00:20:36.881 --> 00:20:39.580
Hey, Makucha, Chuluun.
Remember me?

422
00:20:39.581 --> 00:20:41.040
And my stink?

423
00:20:41.041 --> 00:20:43.000
(FARTING)
(BOTH COUGHING)

424
00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:45.210
Oh, no!

425
00:20:45.211 --> 00:20:47.040
And don't come back.

426
00:20:47.041 --> 00:20:49.250
I guess we make
a pretty good team
after all.

427
00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:53.620
How's Baliyo?

428
00:20:53.621 --> 00:20:55.710
The venom will
wear off eventually.

429
00:20:55.711 --> 00:20:56.920
He will be fine.

430
00:20:56.921 --> 00:20:59.540
You should be
more careful,
little brother.

431
00:20:59.541 --> 00:21:00.620
Not my style.

432
00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:06.460
Nirmala?
I did get the flower.

433
00:21:06.461 --> 00:21:09.080
But it got trampled
in the battle.

434
00:21:09.081 --> 00:21:10.460
You finished the task.

435
00:21:10.461 --> 00:21:12.250
Giving me the flower
wasn't really the point.

436
00:21:12.251 --> 00:21:15.040
Though I would have liked
to have a new flower
to put behind my ear.

437
00:21:15.041 --> 00:21:17.040
Does this mean
Kion's all better?

438
00:21:17.041 --> 00:21:19.960
Does it?
I don't think so.

439
00:21:19.961 --> 00:21:21.830
There's more I have
to do, isn't there?

440
00:21:21.831 --> 00:21:24.080
Yes. You've taken
the first step.

441
00:21:24.081 --> 00:21:25.920
But there's still
a long way to go.

442
00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.790
Guess I just need patience.

443
00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:36.000
We would have made it
if Kion had not shown up.

444
00:21:36.001 --> 00:21:38.000
He is trouble.

445
00:21:38.001 --> 00:21:39.960
The whole Lion Guard
is trouble.

446
00:21:39.961 --> 00:21:41.620
We need to get rid of 'em.

447
00:21:41.621 --> 00:21:44.710
Yeah. Especially
that Bunga.

448
00:21:44.711 --> 00:21:46.580
MAMA BINTURONG:
Oh, yes.

449
00:21:46.581 --> 00:21:49.580
Especially "that Bunga."

450
00:21:49.581 --> 00:21:53.790
No one wants
to get rid of him
more than me.

451
00:21:53.791 --> 00:21:55.000
And who are you?

452
00:21:55.001 --> 00:21:57.500
I'm Mama Binturong.

453
00:21:57.501 --> 00:21:59.500
And I'm your new leader.
