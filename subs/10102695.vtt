I'm afraid we have
no other choice.

(SIGHS) We can still panic.

10
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.040
You don't need to panic.

11
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.619
We just have to figure out
how to get you unstuck.

12
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.460
I simply don't understand.

13
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.330
There used to be
a river here.

14
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.420
But now everything
is so dry.

15
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.920
That's because
it's the dry season.

16
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.579
Ah, the dry season. I see.

17
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.250
But where'd all the water go?

18
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.330
(SIGHS) Maybe it panicked
and ran.

19
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.329
You know what we could
really use? Some rain.

20
00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.209
Oh, yes. Capital idea.

21
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.790
Well, obviously. (SIGHS)

22
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.080

listening to me?

23
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.580
We need to hurry, Kion.

This mud's gettin' drier
by the second.

25
00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:00.539
If it dries up completely,

26
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.420
we'll never get
all these zebras out!

27
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.330
Actually, all we need
is one dark cloud.

28
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.580
You mean like that one?

29
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.620
What are you
thinking, Kion?

30
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.619
I'm thinking
Bunga's right.

31
00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:12.959
We need it to rain.

32
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.830

gonna get rain from?

there was a Roar
to make it stop.

The ground might
be thirsty, Beshte.

59
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.170
But it's so dry, it can't
absorb all this water.

60

for it to go.

before I used the Roar.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:47.379
And the water's
already drying up.

180
00:08:47.379 --> 00:08:49.119
Hippos don't do
so well in the sun

181
00:08:49.119 --> 00:08:51.249
without any water or mud
to cover their skin.

182
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:53.620
Then we've gotta
find him fast. Come on!

183
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:56.080
ONO: Wait for me.

184
00:08:59.879 --> 00:09:01.539
(SIGHS)

185
00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:02.710
That's better.

186
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:04.290
SHUPAVU: What are you doing
in the Outlands, hippo?

187
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:05.750
Huh?

188
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:08.790
Oh. Hey there,
little lizard.

189
00:09:08.831 --> 00:09:11.331
I'm just looking for shade
on my way back
to the Pride Lands.

190
00:09:11.331 --> 00:09:13.749
We could use you
for shade!

191
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:15.080
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

192
00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.670
I bet you could!

193
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:19.460
We can help you find
more shade if you like.

194
00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.750
You can?
Of course we can.

195
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:24.459
Poa! Like my dad says,

196
00:09:24.459 --> 00:09:26.419
"You can make friends
wherever you go."

197
00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.880
(CHUCKLES) How sweet.

198
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.670
Now, follow me.

199
00:09:34.959 --> 00:09:37.079
He's got to be
around here somewhere.

200
00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:44.620
(GROANS) Better tell Kion.

201
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.580
I looked all over
the Outlands,
and there's no sign of him.

202
00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:50.709
I feel terrible.

203
00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:52.710
Don't beat yourself up, Ono.

204
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:55.380
This is my fault, not yours.

205
00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.960
(SIGHS) He's out there
all alone.

206
00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.960
Wait. Beshte's probably
the only hippo
in the Outlands.

207
00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.380
So even if we can't
find him,

208
00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:07.250
we should find
signs of him.

209
00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.790
Ono, could you look
for hippo prints?

210
00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:12.249
If we find those,
they should lead to Beshte.

211
00:10:12.249 --> 00:10:14.119
I wasn't even looking
for footprints.

212
00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.040
You got it, Kion!

213
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.750
And maybe you and I
can track him by scent.

214
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.170
(SNIFFING)

215
00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:21.580
Good thinking, Fuli.
(BOTH SNIFFING)

216
00:10:22.579 --> 00:10:24.919
You smell him?
(SNIFFING)

217
00:10:24.919 --> 00:10:26.169
I don't smell him.

218
00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:27.460
(INHALES DEEPLY)
(BREEZE BLOWS)

219
00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.880
Whoa! What is that smell?

220
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.040
(EXCLAIMS)

221
00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.750
(SIGHS) That's you, Bunga.

222
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:35.079
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
Oh, yeah.

223
00:10:35.079 --> 00:10:36.789
(SNIFFING DEEPLY)

224
00:10:36.789 --> 00:10:38.249
Pure Bunga.

225
00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:41.210
Bunga, why don't you stay
downwind of us

226
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:44.000
so we can track Beshte
without any...

227
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.540
Interference.

228
00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.380
Hmm. Got it.

229
00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:53.500
I know!
I can shout for him

230
00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.210
so he knows
we're looking for him!

231
00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:58.880
(SHOUTS LOUDLY)
Beshte!

232
00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.959
Beshte!

233
00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:05.580
Beshte!

234
00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:07.790
Oh, yeah.
That's much less annoying.

235
00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:09.210
(SNIFFING)

236
00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:11.790
Beshte!

237
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:13.669
Beshte!

238
00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.540
It don't matter what he says.

239
00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:22.620
You two always gotta
listen to me.

240
00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:24.209
You got it, boss.

241
00:11:24.209 --> 00:11:25.919
What'd he say?

242
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.790
He said, listen to me.

243
00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:30.790
Uh, Cheezi?
I was listening to you.

244
00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:33.460
Not me-me. Him-me.

245
00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.710
Who me?

246
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:36.579
So sad.

247
00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:40.460
Psst. Ushari!

248
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.880
I'm right here.

249
00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.960
Yeah, well, I got a secret
you might wanna know.

250
00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.460
Secret?

251
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.920
That hippo from the Lion Guard
is stuck in the Outlands.

252
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.709
Alone.

253
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:53.290
Is he, now?

254
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:57.120
Shupavu's keeping an eye
on him right now.

255
00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.120
Who cares about a hippo?

256
00:12:00.879 --> 00:12:02.669
I care.

257
00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:05.080
Oh, yeah! Yeah! I care tons!

258
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.960
Me, too!

259
00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.500
Uh... why do we care?

260
00:12:08.541 --> 00:12:14.461
Because if the Lion Guard's
strongest is alone
in the Outlands,

261
00:12:14.461 --> 00:12:19.120
it's the perfect opportunity
to eliminate him!

262
00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.500
Yes.

263
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.920
It will weaken the Lion Guard.

264
00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.959
Correct, Ushari.

265
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.870
And then you hyenas will get
to eat whatever you like
in the Pride Lands.

266
00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:35.210
Whatever we want?
Yum!

267
00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:37.959
First
we gotta take out Beshte.

268
00:12:37.959 --> 00:12:39.749
But he's the strongest.

269
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:41.960
How are we supposed
to do that, boss?

270
00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:45.540
Don't call me "boss"
in front of the boss.

271
00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.330
In case
you fools haven't noticed,

272
00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.289
it's the dry season.

273
00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:53.920
Too much sun
makes hippos weak.

274
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.330
Since Beshte already seems
to trust you skinks,

275
00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:00.170
we can use that
to our advantage.

276
00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:02.249
I have a plan.

277
00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:05.170
Listen to him, boys,
he has a plan.

278
00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:07.790
Him you? Or Him-him?

279
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:09.620
Just listen.

280
00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:13.460
Scar always has a plan!
Big plans!

281
00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:18.040
Correct. Big plans indeed.

282
00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:21.790
Now, here's what I want
you to do.

283
00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:28.750
Thanks again
for finding me shade.

284
00:13:28.791 --> 00:13:32.001
The Pride Lands are
all the way on the other side
of Rocky Plateau.

285
00:13:32.001 --> 00:13:35.161
But I don't think
I can make it across
without getting burned.

286
00:13:35.161 --> 00:13:37.079
I got ya covered!

287
00:13:37.079 --> 00:13:39.419
Literally! I know a shortcut.

288
00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:41.960
Through the caves
under Rocky Plateau.

289
00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:42.960
You do?

290
00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.540
And you're sure that's
the right way to go?

291
00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.080
Sure I'm sure.

292
00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:49.959
It'll keep Beshte outta
the sun so he won't burn.

293
00:13:49.959 --> 00:13:51.579
Trust me.

294
00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:54.210
That'd be Poa. Let's go.

295
00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:56.670
The cave's this way.
Follow me.

296
00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.290
Who knew folks were so helpful
in the Outlands?

297
00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:03.379
Lucky I found you guys.
I mean, lucky you found me.

298
00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.580
Whew! Let's go.

299
00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:08.830
Yes. Totally lucky.

300
00:14:12.669 --> 00:14:13.919
This way.

301
00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:20.710
He's falling for it! (LAUGHS)

302
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:22.580
This plan's gonna
work out great.

303
00:14:23.119 --> 00:14:25.289
I dunno, Janja.

304
00:14:25.289 --> 00:14:28.169
Your plans don't usually
work out so good.

305
00:14:28.211 --> 00:14:31.871
This ain't my plan,
fur-brain, remember?
It's Scar's.

306
00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:34.040
Oh, yeah, right.

307
00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.120
Then maybe it will work.

308
00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.289
Exactly!

309
00:14:38.169 --> 00:14:39.419
Hey!

310
00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.580
(SIGHS) Never mind.

311
00:14:41.621 --> 00:14:44.921
Come on, fur-brains.
Let's get over
to Rocky Plateau.

312
00:14:44.921 --> 00:14:46.670
We got work to do.

313
00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:48.039
(LAUGHING)

314
00:14:48.829 --> 00:14:50.249
(SNIFFING)

315
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:55.380
I thought I had him,
but...

316
00:14:55.421 --> 00:14:59.161
(SNIFFING) Yeah,
I'm not having much luck
tracking him either.

317
00:14:59.161 --> 00:15:01.379
It's hard to smell
somebody's scent

318
00:15:01.379 --> 00:15:03.959
when it's been washed away
by so much water.

319
00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.670
(SIGHS) I hope
Ono's having better luck.

320
00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:11.620
Come on, Beshte...

321
00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:12.999
Where did you go?

322
00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:18.040
Those look like
Hippo prints!

323
00:15:20.501 --> 00:15:24.661
Of course!
Beshte went into the cave
to get out of the sun!

324
00:15:24.661 --> 00:15:28.039
Kion! Kion!
I know where Beshte went!

325
00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.460
You found him?
Not exactly. Just follow me.

326
00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.080
His tracks lead in here.

327
00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.169
Nice work, Ono.

328
00:15:36.169 --> 00:15:37.879
Whoa! Look at that!

329
00:15:37.879 --> 00:15:39.079
What is it?

330
00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.540
Big B...
He has really big feet!

331
00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.880
Because he's
a hippo, Bunga.

332
00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.040
Oh, yeah.

333
00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.750
Beshte must have gone in
to get shelter from the sun.

334
00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:48.879
Come on!

335
00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:56.920
So are we getting close
to the end of the caves?

336
00:15:56.961 --> 00:16:00.211
Oh, we're getting close
to the end, all right.
(SNICKERS)

337
00:16:00.211 --> 00:16:01.919
You got a plan, right?

338
00:16:01.919 --> 00:16:03.119
Oh, yeah.

339
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.670
Hurry up.

340
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:09.080
(INHALES) Okay.

341
00:16:11.039 --> 00:16:12.329
(GRUNTS)

342
00:16:12.329 --> 00:16:15.959
Phew!
That was a tight squeeze.

343
00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:19.500
Uh-oh. Hey, little skinks?

344
00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.000
I think we made
a wrong turn somewhere.

345
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.250
This is a dead end.

346
00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:24.749
JANJA: You got that right!
(LAUGHS)

347
00:16:24.749 --> 00:16:25.919
Janja!

348
00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:30.210
And us!
Hello!

349
00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:32.210
Skinks!
You gotta get outta here!

350
00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:33.540
Back the way we came,
before...

351
00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:35.170
Now!

352
00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:36.749
(CHUNGU AND CHEEZI GRUNTING)

353
00:16:36.749 --> 00:16:38.209
Little skinks! Look out!

354
00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:43.380
Uh-oh.

355
00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:45.290
That's right! You're trapped!

356
00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:47.670
And we got lots more rocks
up here!

357
00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:49.879
(LAUGHING)

358
00:16:49.879 --> 00:16:51.209
But not for long!

359
00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.620
At least those
little skinks got away safe.

360
00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:58.920
But I thought
the skinks was with us?

361
00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.709
The hippo don't know that!

362
00:17:00.709 --> 00:17:03.119
Come on,
we got more rocks to push!

363
00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:06.420
(GRUNTING)

364
00:17:06.461 --> 00:17:10.211
Oh, boy! I don't think
I want to be around
when that rock hits!

365
00:17:11.169 --> 00:17:13.419
I just gotta unblock
the entrance.

366
00:17:13.419 --> 00:17:15.619
Twende Kibokoooo!

367
00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:18.080
(ECHOING) Twende Kiboko...

368
00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.210
ALL: Beshte!

369
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:21.880
(GRUNTING)

370
00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:29.960
Beshte!

371
00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.210
Bunga! Not helping!

372
00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.290
Bunga?

373
00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:34.670
It's not, huh?

374
00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:36.790
Beshte,
glad to hear you're okay.

375
00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:39.119
Thanks, Kion. But, uh...

376
00:17:39.161 --> 00:17:43.541
I've kind of got a "hyenas and
falling rock" situation here.

377
00:17:43.541 --> 00:17:47.711
They're pushing down rocks
from an opening
to Rocky Plateau.

378
00:17:47.711 --> 00:17:50.209
And I'm pretty sure
they're trying to hit me!

379
00:17:50.209 --> 00:17:51.579
I know where that is!

380
00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:53.710
I flew over it while
I was looking for Beshte.

381
00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:56.750
Hang in there, Beshte!
We'll handle those hyenas!

382
00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:57.920
Okay...

383
00:17:58.790 --> 00:17:59.960
But hurry.

384
00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.879
I'm runnin' outta places
to go!

385
00:18:01.879 --> 00:18:03.249
Let's go!

386
00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:04.750
Till the Pride Lands end...

387
00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.460
ALL: Lion Guard defend!

388
00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:07.880
This way!

389
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:12.960
Ono, wait!
We can't just fly up there.

390
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.290
You can't, but I can get
pretty close to flying.
Huwezi!

391
00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:19.380
Follow her.

392
00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:29.250
(LAUGHING) Heh-heh. That one
hit real loud. This is fun!

393
00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:30.580
This is fun.

394
00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:34.420
Who cares how loud it is,
fur-brain? Hit the hippo!

395
00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.540
We could if he'd stop moving.

396
00:18:38.249 --> 00:18:42.289
Hey, Beshte. Maybe you could
hold still a second?

397
00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:43.250
I don't think so.

398
00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:47.750
Ha! He's running outta room!

399
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:49.459
Now for the big one.

400
00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.120
(GRUNTING)

401
00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.080
Uh-oh.

402
00:19:00.959 --> 00:19:02.499
(LAUGHING)

403
00:19:02.499 --> 00:19:05.329
One smooshed hippo, comin' up!

404
00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:08.120
Not so fast, Janja!

405
00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:10.710
Fuli! Try to keep
that rock from falling in!

406
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:11.960
On it, Kion!

407
00:19:14.289 --> 00:19:15.459
Totally on it.

408
00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.500
(SNARLS) Back away, Janja.

409
00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:22.210
Hey! Stop with the pecking!

410
00:19:23.709 --> 00:19:24.709
(GRUNTING)

411
00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:31.460
(GRUNTING)

412
00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:32.750
Beshte! Get out of there!

413
00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:36.580
Twende Kiboko!

414
00:19:41.461 --> 00:19:44.421
Thought you could hurt one
of the Lion Guard, did you?

415
00:19:44.421 --> 00:19:47.330
Oh? Is the hippo down there
one of the Lion Guard?

416
00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:49.419
I had no idea.

417
00:19:49.419 --> 00:19:53.039
(FORCED LAUGH)
We were just havin' some fun.

418
00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:58.920
So I got nowhere to run,
eh, cub?

419
00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:02.500
Actually, you can have all
the room you need.

420
00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:06.330
(ROARS)

421
00:20:12.289 --> 00:20:14.579
I never get tired of that.

422
00:20:14.579 --> 00:20:16.999
No rain this time, though.
Oh, well.

423
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.830
Least we got rid of the hyenas
and saved Big B.

424
00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.460
Bunga!
Beshte!

425
00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:28.620
Big B?

426
00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:36.170
BESHTE: Boy, that last rock
sure was a doozy, huh?

427
00:20:36.709 --> 00:20:38.289
(ALL SIGH)

428
00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:40.870
I thought
I was gonna have to
be Big B from now on.

429
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:42.460
Nah... I'm still here.

430
00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:44.710
(YELLING)

431
00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:47.620
So much for that plan.

432
00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:50.789
I guess Scar's plan worked out
as good as one of yours.

433
00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:53.289
(LAUGHING) Huh, Janja?

434
00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:56.500
Think he's gonna be mad?

435
00:20:56.541 --> 00:21:00.161
You know, maybe we don't gotta
go right back to the volcano.

436
00:21:00.161 --> 00:21:02.459
USHARI: Janja? Hyenas?

437
00:21:02.459 --> 00:21:04.579
Scar wants to see you.

438
00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:06.000
Now.

439
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.750
And he's not happy.

440
00:21:12.169 --> 00:21:14.419
(GULPS) Oh, boy.

441
00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:21.710
Beshte, I'm so sorry I got you
swept into the Outlands.

442
00:21:21.751 --> 00:21:25.081
That's okay, Kion. It's not
like you did it on purpose.

443
00:21:25.081 --> 00:21:26.459
You were helping the zebras.

444
00:21:26.459 --> 00:21:28.539
Yeah, and it all worked out
great.

445
00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:31.420
Plus, we got to see all
the hyenas go flying!

446
00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:32.540
(CHUCKLES)

447
00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:34.920
Yeah, and that never
would've happened

448
00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.830
if you guys hadn't come
to look for me.

449
00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:39.209
You can always
count on us, Beshte.

450
00:21:39.209 --> 00:21:40.619
You know it, Big B.

451
00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:42.580
Ow.

452
00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:45.330
Ooh. You really did get burned
out there.

453
00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:47.460
Yeah. It's good to be home.

454
00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:49.580
Where there's lots of shade.

455
00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:50.829
And mud!

456
00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:54.830
Oh, yeah! Gotta love it!

457
00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:57.540
(SIGHS) Do we?

458
00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:59.120
(LAUGHING)

459
00:22:01.579 --> 00:22:03.459

00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:28.329
