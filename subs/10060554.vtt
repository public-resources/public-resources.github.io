Makuu?

Maybe he heard us and ran!

50
00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:49.579
Or swam!

51
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.620

I was having for lunch!

(SCREAMS)
Sorry, didn't mean
to scare you.

Oh, no sign of Goigoi
from above.
(SCREAMS)

57
00:03:04.791 --> 00:03:09.331
I searched around every
tree in these woods.
Not a jackal in sight.

58
00:03:09.331 --> 00:03:12.289
But... My leafy greens
are gone!

59

must have eaten them!

Hmm.

61
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.380
Well, at least
they didn't eat you.

00:03:17.421 --> 00:03:20.831
There's no trace
of Janja and his hyenas
anywhere around here.

64
00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:24.249
Not even their scent.

65
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.290
And, believe me,
if they were around,
you'd smell them.

66
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.290
But they were here!

67
00:03:29.331 --> 00:03:32.501
They've eaten all
the bugs that I was
going to eat for lunch!

68
00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:34.670
Hey, the crocodiles
ate my lunch, too!

69
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.249
And the jackals ate mine!

70
00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:38.619
Did you find Makuu or Goigoi?

71
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.670
Nope!
No.

72
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:40.830
Nothing.
Uh-uh.

73
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.250
Strange.

74
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.580
Janja wasn't here either.

75
00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.420
I bet Makuu, Goigoi,
and Janja heard us coming!

76

See, that's just
how good we are.

77

and all of those
baddies run off!

KION: I'm not so sure.

79
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.120
(SNIFFS) I didn't even
find any hyena tracks.

80
00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.539
No sign of Janja at all.

81
00:03:58.539 --> 00:04:01.749
Hey, wait. I didn't see
any jackal tracks, either!

82
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.210
Did we see crocodile tracks?

83
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.290
Uh, I don't think so.

84
00:04:05.331 --> 00:04:08.711
And last I checked,
none of them eat
roots or leaves.

85
00:04:08.711 --> 00:04:12.999
Right. And Janja
doesn't usually eat bugs...

86
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.380
Are you sure it was Makuu,
Goigoi and Janja you saw?

87
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.540
Well, I didn't
actually see Janja.

88
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.210
I didn't see Goigoi, either.

89
00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:23.959
I didn't stick around
long enough to see Makuu.

90
00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:25.289
But I sure heard him.

91
00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.210
(SHUDDERS) He said, "Mmm-mmm!

92

"You look tasty!

"I'm gonna eat you!"

Goigoi said.

95
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.579
And Janja!

96
00:04:34.579 --> 00:04:36.119
Wait.

97
00:04:36.119 --> 00:04:39.249
Makuu, Goigoi and Janja
all said the same thing?

98
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.330
Something weird is going on.

99
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.380
Ono, scout the Pride Lands.

100
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.250

Makuu, Goigoi and Janja.

101
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.249

No, no, no, I'm not.

A drongo...

121
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.830
Well, don't worry, Tamaa.

122
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.500
We won't let Janja hurt you.

123
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.379
Why would Janja hurt me?

124
00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:38.079
(GASPS) Oh, right!

125
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.250
You heard him just now.

126
00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.170
Yeah, and he sounded close.

127
00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:45.120
Oh, he was.
Very close indeed!

128
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.039
But then he
and his hyenas ran off.

129
00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:50.499
They went...
That-a-way!

130
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.330

actually saw where

You sounded just like Janja.

148
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.830
That's because
he's a drongo.

149
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.290
And drongos can make
their voice sound like
other animals.

150
00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:38.710
Isn't that right?

151
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.710
Yes, it's true.

152
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.790
I can sound
like other animals.

Any other animal
in the Pride Land, really.

154
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.499
It's my little talent.

155
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.580
Which you've been using
to scare animals
all over the Pride Lands.

156
00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:52.750
Admit it!

(CLEARS THROAT)

161
00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.290

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.500
(NORMAL VOICE)
All right, kids.

163
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.920
You got me.

164
00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:11.380
I pretended to be Janja.
And Makuu. And Goigoi.

165
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:15.169
But so what?
Is there any harm in that?

166
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:18.420
You scared little animals,
so they'd run away.

167
00:07:18.461 --> 00:07:22.581
Is it my fault that
my performances
are so convincing?

168
00:07:22.581 --> 00:07:24.169
It's a compliment, really.

169
00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:26.289
But you did it
to steal their food!

170
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:27.460
Steal?

171
00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:28.420
No, no, no!

172
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.330
It's an act!
It's a show!

173
00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:31.790
It's all in fun!

174
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:33.670
I do some voices...

175
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.330
And if my audience happens
to leave me a little food
as a reward,

176
00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.289
well, is that so wrong?

177
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:39.540
Uh, yeah.

178
00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.000
Who do you think you are?

179
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.420
Who do I think I am?

in the Pride Land.

351
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:38.829
So you better
run to the Outlands!

352
00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:44.920
Impalas,
what are you waiting for?

353
00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.830
Hyenas are coming!

354
00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:48.379
Escape to the Outlands!

355
00:14:48.379 --> 00:14:50.039
(GASPS)
Right now!

356
00:14:50.039 --> 00:14:52.289
You don't have
to tell me twice!

357
00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:54.880
Panic and run, panic and run.

Shoo! Scat! Run!

361
00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.960
(LAUGHING)
Let's go, boys.

362
00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.289
Our dinner is being delivered!

363
00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:17.040
I sounded good, didn't I?

364
00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.920
Would you believe I'd never
done Kion's voice before?

365
00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.920
Ya gotta love it. Right?

366
00:15:22.999 --> 00:15:24.959
So, can I go now?

367
00:15:24.959 --> 00:15:26.879
I did what you asked!

368
00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.920
Hmm... Not yet.

369
00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.460
You still might come in handy.

370
00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:35.210
I think I'll keep you
around for a while.

371
00:15:35.829 --> 00:15:37.289
(LAUGHS)

372
00:15:37.289 --> 00:15:39.919
Could you at least
stop breathing on me?

373
00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.920
I've got sensitive feathers.

374
00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.790
(LAUGHING) Sensitive feather.

375
00:15:47.959 --> 00:15:49.749
Pretty quiet.

376
00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:52.039
Guess Tamaa really
is keeping his promise.

377
00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.580
No sign of Janja, Cheezi
and Chungu either.

378
00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:59.290
Panic and run!
Panic and run!

379
00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:00.959
Head for the Outlands.

380
00:16:00.959 --> 00:16:03.119
They're the only
safe place to be.

381
00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.420
Whoa! What? No!

382
00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.750
Where'd you get
such a crazy idea?

383
00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:09.250
From Kion.

384
00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:10.880
I never said that.

385
00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:13.829
Yes you did. I heard you
say it to the impalas.

386
00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:18.540
And everyone knows
zebras have the best
hearing in the Pride Lands.

387
00:16:18.541 --> 00:16:22.921
So if you heard Kion say
"Go to the Outlands,"
why didn't you go?

388
00:16:22.921 --> 00:16:25.619
I am going!
I just...

389
00:16:25.619 --> 00:16:28.539
Uh, don't know
where the Outlands are.

390
00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:31.000
Hold on.
You say you heard me?

391
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.620
But you didn't see me.

392
00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:35.290
So? Hearing is believing.

393
00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:37.329
Not with Tamaa
the drongo around.

394
00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:41.460
But why would Tamaa
fool the impalas into
going to the Outlands?

395
00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:43.920
(SCOFFS) Sounds more
like Janja to me.

396
00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.080
Maybe it was Janja.
And Tamaa.

397
00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.789
I know Tamaa's a troublemaker,

398
00:16:48.789 --> 00:16:51.209
but you really think
he'd help Janja?

399
00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:53.210
Maybe he didn't have a choice.

400
00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:55.710
C'mon, Lion Guard.
To the Outlands!

401
00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:59.080
Just a minute.

402
00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.709
I thought we weren't
supposed to go
to the Outlands!

403
00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:05.920
(LAUGHING)

404
00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.170
Come on, fellas!

405
00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:17.790
(GRUNTING)

406
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.620
(CHUCKLING)

407
00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:25.120
This was so easy.

408
00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:28.169
I should've got myself
a drongo a long time ago.

409
00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:30.500
You better
get used to us, birdy.

410
00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:33.210
'Cause I'm never
letting you go!

411
00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:34.750
(LAUGHS)

412
00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:36.080
Hear that?

413
00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.169
You're never
gettin' away from us!

414
00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:43.040
Why would I want to get away?

415
00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.670
This is a great set-up!

416
00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:47.380
(LAUGHING) Yeah! Huh?

417
00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:49.079
I've always worked alone.

418
00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:51.620
But it's gonna be a lot
easier now that I have
a partner.

419
00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:52.920
Partner?

420
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.170
Sure!

421
00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:55.620
Didn't you hear Janja?

422
00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:59.080
From now on it's just
gonna be me and him!

423
00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.379
Just you and Janja?

424
00:18:01.379 --> 00:18:03.169
What about us?

425
00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:06.750
Oh, I hadn't thought
about that.

426
00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:08.460
With me helping Janja,

427
00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:11.080
I don't know if he'll
need you two anymore.

428
00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.039
He won't?

429
00:18:12.039 --> 00:18:13.459
Not with me around.

430
00:18:13.459 --> 00:18:16.669
But if you were to
let me go...

431
00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:19.170
Uh-uh.

432
00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:21.540
Ah. Ow. Easy.

433
00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.880

Nice try, birdie.

434
00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:27.329
But we ain't lettin'
you go till Janja
says so.

435
00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:28.750
Is that a fact?

436
00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:30.290
Yeah.
Uh-huh.

437
00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:34.080
I see...

438
00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.170
Cheezi, let the bird go!

439
00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:37.539
Uh, okay, Janja.

(TAMAA LAUGHING)

441
00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:43.330
I don't think it was really
Janja who said that.

442

No kidding.

443
00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:47.170
Janja's gonna be
super mad.

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:49.079
What are we
gonna tell him?

445
00:18:49.079 --> 00:18:51.039
How about...

446
00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:51.960

me out of that mess.

449
00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.960
But it got those
impalas into a mess.

and help 'em.

the hyenas, Ono?

460

Negative.
I don't see them.

This is your last chance,
hyenas!

462

But I do hear something!

463
00:19:51.119 --> 00:19:53.249
Leave now or we're
gonna come get you!

I don't know.
Maybe we can...
