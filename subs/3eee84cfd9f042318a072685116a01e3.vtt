Finally.

7
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.670

to go around the lake?

It's pretty big.
Could take all night.

The lake.
It's hard.

13
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.580
The lake isn't "hard."
It's ice.

14
00:01:37.581 --> 00:01:39.620
It's so cold,
it must have frozen over.

15
00:01:39.621 --> 00:01:42.880
Yeah, well, it's "ice" enough
that we can walk on it.

16
00:01:42.881 --> 00:01:44.170
Maybe all the way across.

17
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:45.710
You think it's safe?

18
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.290
Ah, I'm not sure. It could be.
But I think we should
test it first.

19
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.170
How do we do that?
Maybe like that?

20
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.830
This is great.
Hoo hoo ha!

21
00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.750
C'mon out.
The ice is fine.

22
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.830
I think Bunga's right.
That looks like the fastest
way to go. C'mon.

Can you reach her?

Now, let's get off this ice.

Oh, no, my staff!

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.960
It must have slipped off

I don't see it.
Must be under the ice.

61
00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.460
So we don't have any Tuliza?

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.500
I just realized.

70
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:20.460
Without Makini's staff,
we can't bring the

71

So?
So,

72

we can't be sure it's really
a moja kwa moja stone.

don't you, Ono?

If this is the last

76

we should wait
until morning.

on the other side

we'll be able to see better.

any better just waiting here.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.120
Thanks.

176
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.250
(GRUNTS)
Hey!

177
00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.120
I don't know what
we did to you,

178
00:09:21.121 --> 00:09:22.960
but this's gotta be
a misunderstanding.

179
00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:27.000
Misunderstanding?
Is that what you
call this rock slide?

180
00:09:27.001 --> 00:09:28.000
(RANI GROWLS)

181
00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:32.120
(PANTING) The rock slide
was an accident. We didn't
mean to start it.

182
00:09:32.121 --> 00:09:34.290
(BALIYO AND KION GRUNTING)

183
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:37.670
And your lion friend
attacking my little brother
is an accident, too?

184
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:38.960
(GROWLS)

185
00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:42.290
Makini. Ono.
Get me outta here.
I gotta help fight.

186
00:09:42.291 --> 00:09:46.290
We're trying. But you need
to stop squirming. You're
making more rocks fall.

187
00:09:46.291 --> 00:09:48.830
Fine. Then at least
let me get a good view.

188
00:09:48.831 --> 00:09:51.000
(ONO SQUAWKS)
That's better.

189
00:09:51.001 --> 00:09:52.500
Whoa.
Look at that!

190
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:56.500
BUNGA:
It's like we're fighting
a Lion Guard made of lions.

191
00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.000
FULI: Ugh.

192
00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.500
You fight good.

193
00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.830
But I fight even more good!

194
00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:06.210
KION: Ah, oof.

195
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.250
(GROWLS)
I don't know who you are.

196
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.580
But we've come too far
to let you stop us now.

197
00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.420
(GASPS) What?
What is that?

198
00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.040
(KION ROARS)

199
00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:26.290
Did you see that, too?
Indeed.

200
00:10:26.291 --> 00:10:29.170
I've heard stories of a
lion with a powerful roar.

201
00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:31.000
But not since I was a cub.

202
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.460
Rani? How do you
want to proceed?

203
00:10:33.461 --> 00:10:34.460
(GROWLS)

204
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.420
Kion.
You're out of control.

205
00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:43.880
Fuli.
I... Yeah.
I guess I was.

206
00:10:43.881 --> 00:10:44.960
(RANI GRUNTS)

207
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:47.460
Lion, who are you?

208
00:10:47.461 --> 00:10:49.290
What?
Who are you?

209
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:52.330
I'm Rani. Leader
of the Night Pride.

210
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:53.960
Night Pride?

211
00:10:53.961 --> 00:10:56.420
We protect everyone
at the Tree of Life

212
00:10:56.421 --> 00:11:00.960
from those who might
cause them harm.
Like you. And your roar.

213
00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:03.880
I'm sorry. We're really
not a threat.

214
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.330
I can explain.

215
00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:08.620
You may say you and your
friends mean no harm.

216
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.500
But actions speak
louder than words.

217
00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:14.250
We're not here
to harm anyone.

218
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:22.670
Thanks. Rani,
my name's Kion.

219
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.330
My friends and I have been
on a very long journey.

220
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:29.620
We need to get
to the Tree of Life
to get help. I need help.

221
00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.290
I'm sure you do.

222
00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.710
But your roar sent
my brother flying.

223
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.540
I can only imagine

224
00:11:35.541 --> 00:11:38.170
the damage you could do
to everyone living at
the Tree of Life.

225
00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:40.750
But, I...
You, and your "friends,"

226
00:11:40.751 --> 00:11:43.210
will never be welcome
at the Tree of Life.

227
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:45.460
Leave now,
and never return.

228
00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:47.330
Night Pride.
Together!

229
00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.460
I...
I can't believe it.

230
00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.170
So, now what?

231
00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.790
BUNGA:
Uh, maybe get me outta here?

232
00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:04.790
Yeah.
Come on.

233
00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.790
Hey, hey, Kion?
You don't have
to listen to her.

234
00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.330
You've got the Roar.

235
00:12:11.331 --> 00:12:14.170
Those lions can't stop us
from goin' to
the Tree of Life.

236
00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:18.210
Bunga, just because
we can do something,
doesn't mean we should.

237
00:12:18.211 --> 00:12:21.040
Really? Any time
I can eat a grub,
I do.

238
00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:22.460
Fuli's right, Lil B.

239
00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:24.830
We want to be welcomed
at the Tree of Life.

240
00:12:24.831 --> 00:12:26.040
Not fight our way in.

241
00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:28.880
We did start the rock slide
and block the pass.

242
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.170
Maybe the lions were
just defending their home.

243
00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:34.710
Just like we would
if someone started a rock
slide in the Pride Lands.

244
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.330
Does this mean we're
not going to the
Tree of Life now?

245
00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:41.330
No. We just need to come up
with another plan.
Right, Kion?

246
00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:45.460
Kion?

247
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.750
Okay. For now
let's get Bunga out
of these rocks.

248
00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.120
Hey.
Did you see me fly?

249
00:12:58.121 --> 00:13:00.170
Little brother.
You're okay.

250
00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:01.500
Of course, I'm okay.

251
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:04.500
And I'm not your
little brother.
I'm just younger.

252
00:13:04.501 --> 00:13:05.500
Whoa.

253
00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:08.500
So who were those strangers?

254
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.170
And what was that roar thing?

255
00:13:11.171 --> 00:13:12.960
It was like something
from a legend.

256
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:15.790
It doesn't matter
who they were.
They're gone now.

257
00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:18.000
But I should tell
Queen Janna what happened.

258
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:21.080
Surak? Nirmala?
Stay with Baliyo.

259
00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:23.710
Make sure
he's really okay.

260
00:13:23.711 --> 00:13:25.330
Of course.
We will.

261
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.120
You know? I always thought
flyin' would be more fun.

262
00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:30.540
Come on, Baliyo.

263
00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:32.330
Let's get you
something for your head.

264
00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.000
Whoa.

265
00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:43.250
Queen Janna? Grandmother?
Are you awake?

266
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:46.500
Yes, Rani.
Is everything okay?

267
00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.790
Yes. At least,
it is now.

268
00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:53.460
Come, come, my dear.
What's wrong?

269
00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:56.920
A very strange group
of animals caused a rock slide

270
00:13:56.921 --> 00:13:58.620
that blocked off
the mountain pass.

271
00:13:58.621 --> 00:13:59.670
Oh?

272
00:13:59.671 --> 00:14:01.040
Yes.

273
00:14:01.041 --> 00:14:03.920
They were led by a lion
with a scar across his eye.

274
00:14:03.921 --> 00:14:06.380
A scar? Hmm.

275
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:10.210
But we fought them off.
And I told them to leave
and never return.

276
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:13.830
I promise, Grandmother.
They'll never get
to the Tree of Life.

277
00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:16.460
I believe you.
Well done, Rani.

278
00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:20.040
(WRY LAUGH) The lion
actually had a roar

279
00:14:20.041 --> 00:14:22.580
powerful enough
to send Baliyo flying.

280
00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:26.920
The Roar.

281
00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:29.500
It has finally returned.

282
00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:33.750

works up an appetite.

Oh, yeah. Bees!

ALL: Bunga!
Oh, right.

310
00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:44.000
Hey. Kion. Look.
I'm outta the rocks.

311
00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:46.960
Now we can go
to the Tree of Life.

312
00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.750
I'm glad you're out, Bunga.
But I don't think we can
go the Tree of Life.

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:52.790
Wha? Why not?

314
00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.960
Because I lost control
of the Roar. Again.

315
00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:58.250
Maybe the leader of the
Night Pride is right.

316
00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:00.960
Maybe it's not safe to let me
go to the Tree of Life.

317
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:04.670
I'm sorry. I took you all
on this journey.

318
00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.250
You stuck with me
through it all. And then,

319
00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:10.540
when we finally get here,
I ruined everything.

320
00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:14.500
Kion. We know you
didn't mean to lose
control of the Roar.

321
00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:18.000
Maybe if we talk to the
Night Pride again,
we can explain everything.

322
00:17:18.001 --> 00:17:19.330
Yeah.
Worth a try.

323
00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:20.670
Don't worry, Kion.

324
00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.830
Even if we can't get
to the Tree of Life,

325
00:17:22.831 --> 00:17:24.790
We can find another way
to heal your scar.

326
00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:26.920
And we won't give up
until we do.

327
00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:29.830
You know, Ono?
You're right.
We won't give up.

328
00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:33.290
Because my scar isn't the only
thing that needs healing.

329
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.540
So, this Roar is a good thing?

330
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:38.170
Yes. And it can
be a great thing.

331
00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:40.790
What about the scar
on his eye?
Didn't you say...

332
00:17:40.791 --> 00:17:43.000
We all have our scars, Rani.

333
00:17:43.001 --> 00:17:44.250

334
00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.000
We're the same?

335
00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:51.580
Yeah. But I'm still not sure
I totally understand
why you think...

336
00:17:51.581 --> 00:17:53.670
All will be clear soon enough.

337
00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:59.120
But right now I need you to go
and welcome this lion and his
friends to the Tree of Life.

338
00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:01.330
Okay.
And, hurry,

339
00:18:01.331 --> 00:18:03.580
before they actually
do leave for good.

340
00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:06.000
Yes. Of course, Grandmother.

341
00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:07.500
Thank you, Rani.

342
00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.790
C'mon, Rani.
Let's go.

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:16.120
Go? Go where?

344
00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:17.380
Back to the pass.

345
00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:21.170
We can't just tell
those strangers to go away.
We gotta make them.

346
00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:23.250
Glad you're feeling better,
Baliyo.

347
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.330
But the Queen was actually
excited to hear about
the strange lion's Roar.

348
00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:30.080
Huh? She was?

349
00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:32.000
So it was the
Roar of the Elders.

350
00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:33.580
I guess so.

351
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:37.920
Which means we must welcome
the lion and his friends
to the Tree of Life.

352
00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:42.500
Welcome them?
Did you see that Roar?
Cause I felt it and...

353
00:18:42.501 --> 00:18:44.120
It is the power of legends.

354
00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:46.080
We'll need to treat him
with care.

355
00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:47.580
Treat him with care?

356
00:18:47.581 --> 00:18:50.290
That Roar thing sent me flying
all the way through the pass.

357
00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.040
We gotta go do something.

358
00:18:52.041 --> 00:18:55.290
Baliyo? Let's think
before we react.

359
00:18:55.291 --> 00:18:56.500
<i>Arama karo.</i>

360
00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:02.120
Relax. Right.
(SIGHS) Sorry.

361
00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:04.790
Give me a moment, too?
Of course.

362
00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:10.920
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

363
00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.080
Mom? Dad?

364
00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.000
We're here, Rani.

365
00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:22.620
How are you?

366
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
I'm okay.
But I need some advice.

367
00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:29.580
Grandmother wants me
to welcome a strange
lion and his friends

368
00:19:29.581 --> 00:19:32.790
to the Tree of Life. But I'm
not sure that I should.

369
00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.540
What if I let them in
and something bad happens?

370
00:19:35.541 --> 00:19:37.960
It's my job to protect
the Tree of Life.

371
00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:42.040
I'm proud you take your duty
so seriously, Rani.

372
00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:44.920
But the Queen is very wise.

373
00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:49.290
She wouldn't ask you
to let them in
if it wasn't okay.

374
00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:51.120
Listen to her, Rani.

375
00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:55.620
She's preparing you
to lead more than
just the Night Pride.

376
00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:59.290
Yes. One day you will be
Queen as well.

377
00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.290
I know. You're right.

378
00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:05.380
We know you'll do
the right thing, Rani.

379
00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:07.080
You always do.

380
00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:09.540
Thanks, Mom.
Thanks, Dad.

381
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.920
Of course.
You're welcome.

382
00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.830
Keep up. We need to find them
before they've gone too far.

383
00:20:23.831 --> 00:20:25.380
I still don't get why we're...

384
00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.500
They cleared the pass.

385
00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:35.330
And yet, they didn't
continue any closer
to the Tree of Life.

386
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.380
You're still here.

387
00:20:38.381 --> 00:20:41.000
Yes. And I need
to apologize.

388
00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:43.420
I'm sorry
for using my Roar.

389
00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:46.290
And I understand
if you won't
allow me to enter.

390
00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:49.880
But could you let my friend
Ono complete the journey
to the Tree of Life?

391
00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:52.120
He wasn't part
of the earlier fight.

392
00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:54.330
And his eyes need healing.

393
00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:55.830
Please?

394
00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:01.080
Oh. Of course,
we will welcome Ono.

395
00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:03.960
Thank you.

396
00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:08.790
But anyone who is willing
to put their friend's
well-being before their own

397
00:21:08.791 --> 00:21:10.120
is worthy as well.

398
00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:16.000
Kion. You and your friends
are all welcome
at the Tree of Life.

399
00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:18.000
Oh, thank you.

400
00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.830
By the way?
We're called
the Lion Guard.

401
00:21:21.831 --> 00:21:24.500
Lion Guard?
You only got one lion.

402
00:21:24.501 --> 00:21:25.920
Yeah. You get used to it.

403
00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:30.250
Very well. Kion?
Lion Guard? Follow me.

404
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:38.460
Hey, Kion.
Just don't do that Roar thing
at me again. Ever.

405
00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:40.580
I won't. I promise.

406
00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:48.380
Lion Guard? We're here.

407
00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:56.000
RANI:
Welcome to the Tree of Life.
