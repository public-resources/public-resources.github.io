It's full of...

Hyenas!

12
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.880
Hyenas again?

13
00:01:29.921 --> 00:01:33.751
We've had to chase them
out of the Pride Lands
every night this week!

14
00:01:33.751 --> 00:01:38.160
I know one thing that'll
scare them away from
the aardvarks' den for good.

Things have been pretty quiet
since we chased those hyenas
off the other night, huh?

26
00:02:17.621 --> 00:02:19.750
Well, Kion did
most of the work.

27

Yeah, but we had his back!

A big hollow tree
is falling apart!

A tree falling apart?
That's not really
an emergency.

46
00:03:06.161 --> 00:03:09.460
Yes, it is! It's the tree
where the Mekundu Bats live!

47
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:10.919
They're asleep inside!

48
00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:12.329
Why didn't you wake them up?

49
00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.579
I would,
but, you know...

50
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.670
(SHUDDERS)
...they're bats.

51
00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.170
You're afraid of bats?

00:03:18.211 --> 00:03:21.251
You're the bravest.
I'm the keenest of sight.
Okay?

53
00:03:21.251 --> 00:03:24.169
You were right to get us, Ono.
Come on, everybody.

I am not okay
with all the termites
around here.

90
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.210
You're right.
There's a lot of them.

91
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.540
I've never seen
so many termites.

92
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.289
They ate through
the whole tree.

93
00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:14.789
Maybe they ate through
the tree bridge, too.

94
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.670
I bet that's why it collapsed!

95
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.420
That certainly makes sense.
Termites eat wood.

96
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.580
So too many termites
would eat too much wood.

97
00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.579
But we've always had termites
in the Pride Lands.

98
00:05:24.579 --> 00:05:25.999
Why are there too many now?

99
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.670
Hey! Just because
there are a lot of termites,

100
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.250
it doesn't mean
there's too many.

101

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.290
Okay. There may be
a few too many.

104
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.500
We have to tell my dad.

Let me guess.

106
00:05:43.211 --> 00:05:47.211
You're here to tell me that
there are too many termites
in the Pride Lands?

107

KION:
Um, yeah.

108
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.790
The thing is,
we don't know why
there are so many termites.

109
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.460
Hmm. Maybe we should
ask the aardwolves.

110
00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.580
Aardwolves?
That's right.

111
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.459
They're the Pride Lands'
termite experts.

112
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.380
I've heard of aardwolves,
but I've never seen one.

113
00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.580
I'm not surprised.
They're very shy.

114
00:06:06.621 --> 00:06:09.751
They only come out at night,
and pretty much
keep to themselves.

115
00:06:09.751 --> 00:06:14.039
But they love to eat termites.
Even more than you do!

116
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.500
Not possible!

117
00:06:16.541 --> 00:06:20.041
So the aardwolves keep
the Pride Lands' termites
under control?

118
00:06:20.041 --> 00:06:22.920
That's right.
At least, until now.

119
00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.879
I sure hope
nothing happened to them.

120
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.870
Yeah. We better talk to
the aardwolves and make sure
they're okay.

121
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.540
Where do they live?
Well, they tend to
roam around.

122
00:06:31.581 --> 00:06:35.501
But their favorite places to
sleep are empty aardvark dens.

123
00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:38.619
Empty aardvark dens?

124
00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.790
Ha! That's funny.

125
00:06:40.831 --> 00:06:44.541
We just chased hyenas
out of an empty aardvark den
a couple days ago!

126
00:06:44.541 --> 00:06:49.250
Uh, Dad? What exactly
do aardwolves look like?

127
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.790
Well, they actually look
a lot like hyenas.

128
00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.540
I was afraid you'd say that.

129
00:06:55.581 --> 00:07:00.211
Dad, I... I think I kicked
the aardwolves out of
the Pride Lands.

130
00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:01.959
It was a mistake.

131
00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.540
I thought they were hyenas.

132
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.460
We all did.
I still do!

133
00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:06.790
Thanks, guys.

134
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:09.210

the Roar on them.

You Roared at the aardwolves?

136
00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:14.209
Well, that explain
the termites.

137
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:16.170
I'm sorry, Dad.

138
00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:20.080
Kion, you've made a mistake.

139
00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.380
We all do.

140
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:22.539
But it's what you do

141
00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:23.829
to correct your mistakes

142
00:07:23.829 --> 00:07:25.329

those aardwolves,

147

to the Pride Lands!

snack before we left.

Those poor aardwolves must be
gettin' awful hungry.

BESHTE: Surround them?

177
00:08:48.789 --> 00:08:51.579
Still think they're
just passing by?

178
00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.500
But why? Why?

179
00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.080
Oh, look!
Is that a bug?

180
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.419
Pfft! All this tracking's
taking too long.

181
00:09:01.419 --> 00:09:04.039

on somebody and surround
them just to say hello.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.040
I found 'em!
They're goin' that way!

189
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.379
But why are they running away?

190
00:09:24.379 --> 00:09:26.209
I don't know, Beshte.

191
00:09:26.251 --> 00:09:29.211
All I know is that we've gotta
convince 'em to come back
to the Pride Lands!

192
00:09:29.211 --> 00:09:30.580
Now come on!

193
00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:33.750

It really is the Lion Guard!

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:40.420
Why didn't somebody
say something?

197
00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.290
They're coming
after us!

198
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:45.380
Run faster!

199
00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.620
Wow. They're pretty fast.

Oh, you want fast?

You okay?

205
00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:03.880
They didn't stop.

206
00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.460
Yeah, we noticed.

207
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:06.750
That was weird.

208
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:08.120
Wait.

209
00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.620
They're afraid of us.

210
00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:11.120
Afraid of us?

211
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.709
Well, I did use
the Roar on them.

212
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:15.790
Maybe they think
we're out to get them.

213
00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:17.960
You mean they think
we're the bad guys?

214
00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.250
But we're
the Lion Guard.

215
00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:20.710
We can't be
the bad guys.

216
00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:22.620
And you didn't mean
to Roar at them.

217
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:24.289
It was an honest mistake.

218
00:10:24.289 --> 00:10:26.619
Yeah, but they
don't know that.

219
00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.330
So we've gotta convince
them we're the good guys.

220
00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.960
Of course, we've gotta
find them again first.

221
00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.670

them right there!

(SIGHS) So now what?

You've already kicked me
and the others out of
the Pride Lands!

Where do you want
us to go now?

We want you to come
back to the Pride Lands!

239
00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.329
You want us to go back?

just not to kick us out
in the first place?

Look, I'm really sorry.

Do I look like a hyena to you?

250
00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.209
Pretty much.
Yep.

251
00:11:48.209 --> 00:11:49.499
Uh-huh.

00:11:49.499 --> 00:11:52.379
You aardwolves really don't
get out much, do you?

We still need to find
the rest of your pack.

So we can take you all home.

in the first place?

It's because of him
we're safe.

Maybe.

276
00:12:48.289 --> 00:12:50.249
I'll take a peek,
just to be sure.

277
00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:56.080

What?

286
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:16.210
Was I snorin'?

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:18.500
Oh, never mind.
Keep sleeping if you want.

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:21.290

for me and the kids.

289
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.080
You had me at aardwolf.

290
00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.999
Thought so.

291
00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.830
Smells like
a whole pack of 'em
just moved in next door.

292
00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:31.000
When did the hyraxes
move out?

293
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.170
They didn't.

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:33.750
Oh, yeah. (CHUCKLES)

295
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:35.290
They were delicious.

Now that you're up,

297
00:13:36.579 --> 00:13:40.119
time we said hello
to our new neighbors.

you say, dear.

was a great idea!

It's roomy, nice and dank,
wall to wall dirt...

301
00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:50.879
Oh. Too bad there's
nothing here to eat.

302
00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.380

say that!

303
00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:55.670
(GASPS)

304
00:13:55.670 --> 00:14:00.120
We're the folks
from next door!
Howdy, neighbors!

305
00:14:00.161 --> 00:14:02.709
(SIGHS) You scared us
for a second there!

306
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:04.830
We thought you were
the Lion Guard.

307
00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:06.710
Lion Guard? Where?

308
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:07.790
Twern't me!

309
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:08.830
Rairai made me do it!

310
00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:09.830
Goigoi...
Hey!

311
00:14:11.669 --> 00:14:13.999
Oh! You don't
like 'em either?

312
00:14:13.999 --> 00:14:16.709
Well, don't worry.
They'll never find us.

313
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:18.460
We totally gave
them the slip!

314
00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:20.420
I think.

315
00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:22.830
I see.

316
00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:26.379
Well, now, you just set
your minds at ease.

317
00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.750
We're the furthest thing
from the Lion Guard.

318
00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:30.380
Believe you me.

319
00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:31.750
And...

320
00:14:31.791 --> 00:14:34.581
Why exactly were you running
away from the Lion Guard?

321
00:14:34.581 --> 00:14:37.119
Because they're mean!
And they're scary!

322
00:14:37.119 --> 00:14:39.039
Say it, sister!

323
00:14:39.081 --> 00:14:42.501
But mainly because
Kion's Roar sent us flying
out of the Pride Lands!

324
00:14:42.501 --> 00:14:44.710
And then they came
after us here!

325
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:46.540
You won't tell them
where we are, will you?

326
00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:48.289
Don't you worry about that.

327
00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:52.120
I promise, the Lion Guard
won't find hide
nor hair of you.

328
00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:54.830
Well, maybe a little hide.

329
00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:56.960
And maybe a little hair.

330
00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.250

what friends do...

Have each other for dinner!

335
00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:08.380
Ow!

into that cave?

Tell the other aardwolves
we're not a threat?

390
00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:46.620
Sure. I can do that.

391

Just pop your head out when
you know they won't run.

392

to the Pride Lands.

No way!

411

No!

to kick us out!

416

we were hyenas!

Okay, now I see it.

419
00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:54.119
Anyway, they want to take
us back to the Pride Lands.

420
00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:57.880
Since we left,
it's crawling with termites!

421
00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.620
Mmm. Termites?
Crawling with 'em?

422
00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:03.289
Yeah, and we can
eat 'em all!

423
00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:05.620
They need us to!

424
00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:08.670
You hear that?
We can go home
and eat termites!

425
00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:10.920

are leaving this cave hungry.

are leaving at all!

scared of us?

believe Mjomba?
