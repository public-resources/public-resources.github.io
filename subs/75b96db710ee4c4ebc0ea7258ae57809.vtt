a hard day for you.

it was up to the Queen.

I was worried
you had forgotten about me.

399
00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:26.210
No, Grandfather.

400
00:16:26.211 --> 00:16:27.420
I didn't forget about you.

401
00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.250
It's just...

402
00:16:29.251 --> 00:16:30.330
I was afraid to face you.

403
00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:33.790
I've got this scar now.

404
00:16:33.791 --> 00:16:35.250
And I was worried
that I might turn evil,

405
00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:36.960
like Scar.

406
00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.460
Especially since
I kept losing my temper

407
00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.080
and losing control
of the Roar

408
00:16:42.081 --> 00:16:43.120
on our way
to the Tree of Life.

409
00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.120
Kion, you could have
talked to me anytime.

410
00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:49.210
I told you
I would always

411
00:16:49.211 --> 00:16:50.250

412
