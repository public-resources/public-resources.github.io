Whoa!

00:01:29.921 --> 00:01:31.330
Kion!

10
00:01:31.331 --> 00:01:32.620
Here,
let me help you.

11
00:01:32.621 --> 00:01:34.750
I don't need help.
I'm fine!

12
00:01:34.751 --> 00:01:36.250
Let's just
keep walking.

13
00:01:36.251 --> 00:01:38.540
Looks like Kion
could use some Tuliza.

14
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.500
What? I said I'm fine!

15
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.290
See? He's fine!

16
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.620
Makini?

17
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.000
Tuliza, coming up!

18
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.500
Oh.

19
00:01:50.501 --> 00:01:51.750
Don't tell me...

20
00:01:51.751 --> 00:01:54.080
I really need
to do a better job

21
00:01:54.081 --> 00:01:55.830
keeping track
of our Tuliza.

22
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.710
Out of Tuliza again?

23
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.330
I'll find some.

24
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.960
Let's just hope Kion
doesn't decide to Roar

25
00:02:05.961 --> 00:02:07.500
before we get
more Tuliza.

26
00:02:07.501 --> 00:02:10.080
The journey through
the desert has been
hard on everyone.

27
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.040
At least nobody's
too thirsty.

28
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.170
Thirsty?

29
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.420
Water! Water!
I'm so thirsty!

30
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.330
Uh, except
maybe Bunga.

31
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.670
It's like there's
a whole desert
inside my mouth.

32
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.040
Thee? Dry ath a thand dune.

33
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.250
Ugh. Put that thing away.

34
00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:33.380
Kion.

35
00:02:33.381 --> 00:02:34.460
Kion.

36
00:02:34.461 --> 00:02:36.040
Wanna thee?
Ugh!

37
00:02:36.041 --> 00:02:37.790
Bunga!
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!

38
00:02:37.791 --> 00:02:39.330
Sorry!

39
00:02:39.331 --> 00:02:41.040
Kion,
calm down.

40
00:02:41.041 --> 00:02:42.540
Bunga was just fooling around.

41
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.210
Yeah. It was just
Bunga being Bunga.

42
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.040
Sorry, everybody.
Sorry, Bunga.

43
00:02:48.041 --> 00:02:51.210
Hakuna matata.
I am pretty good
at being annoying.

44
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.380
Yeah. Come on.
Let's keep going.

45
00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.960
(SIGHS) Come on, Anga.

46
00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.000
Find us some Tuliza.

47
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.830
Tuliza... Tuliza... Tuliza...

48
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.920
Yes!

49
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.580
Anga!
Find any Tuliza?

50
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:15.080
Yep. But it's really
far away.

51
00:03:15.081 --> 00:03:16.250
How far?

52
00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.000
Very. Way past
the sea up ahead.

53
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.290
A sea?
You say you saw a sea?

54
00:03:21.291 --> 00:03:23.250
Big B!
She saw a sea!

55
00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.420
Yeah, Little B.
I heard her.

56
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:27.580
But a sea means water.
And water means...

57
00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.330
Water!

58
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.380
Bunga!

59
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.540
Guess we better
go after him.

60
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.540
Whoa! Anga was right!

61
00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.210
It's a sea!

62
00:03:42.211 --> 00:03:43.380
ANGA: Like I said.

63
00:03:43.381 --> 00:03:45.210
BESHTE: <i> Poa!
</i> Look at all that...

64
00:03:45.211 --> 00:03:46.290
Water!

65
00:03:46.291 --> 00:03:47.540
Bunga, wait!
Don't drink it!

66
00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.290
(SLURPS)

67
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.920
It might be salty.

68
00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:56.210
This water is salty!

69
00:03:56.211 --> 00:03:57.500
Blegh!

70
00:03:57.501 --> 00:03:58.880
I gotta get this taste
outta my mouth!

71
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.920
Ble-ugh!

72
00:04:02.921 --> 00:04:04.330
This rock tastes gross.

73
00:04:04.331 --> 00:04:07.120
Why would I lick
a strange rock?
I need water!

74
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:08.920
(SLURPS)

75
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.420
Oh, right. Salty.

76
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.790
Well, if we can't
drink the water,
we should move on.

77
00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:17.830
I need Tuliza.

78
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.290
You think Kion can
make it to the Tuliza?

79
00:04:21.291 --> 00:04:23.620
Doubt it. It's still
pretty far away.

80
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.290
Sorry the Bunga Sea
turned out to be so salty.

81
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.170
The Bunga Sea?

82
00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.580
Sure! I was the first one in,
so I get to name it!

83
00:04:32.581 --> 00:04:35.670
(GASPS) Oh, wait!
I just remembered something!

84
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.710
Rafiki says that
really salty water
can be very relaxing.

85
00:04:39.711 --> 00:04:42.330
But you don't drink it,
you soak in it!

86
00:04:42.331 --> 00:04:44.830
Come on, Kion.
Just try it. Please?

87
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.380
Makini's right.

88
00:04:46.381 --> 00:04:48.750
Salty water should
help soothe your scar.

89
00:04:48.751 --> 00:04:50.380
I should have
thought of that.

90
00:04:50.381 --> 00:04:52.420
Okay. I'll give it a try.

91
00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.460
(SIGHS)

92
00:04:58.461 --> 00:05:00.080
Well?
How do you feel?

(EXHALES)

94
00:05:01.921 --> 00:05:04.830
You know what?
You're right.
I do feel better.

95
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.330
Mmm.

is a-mazing!

98
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.960
Now it's
the "Great" Bunga Sea?

(WATER BUBBLING)

100
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.830
Uh, guys?
Something's happening.

101
00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.000
Whoa! Check it out!
I'm floating!

102
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:30.540
Makes sense.

103
00:05:30.541 --> 00:05:33.080
The saltier the water is,
the easier it is to float.

104
00:05:33.081 --> 00:05:34.080
<i> Poa!</i>

105
00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.750
Aah. This feels great.

106
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.710
The Great Bunga Sea
is super amazing!

107
00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:41.880
Ugh!

108
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.960
Come on, Big B!

109
00:05:43.961 --> 00:05:45.830
The Great Bunga Sea's
a-waitin'!

110
00:05:45.831 --> 00:05:47.080
Don't you wanna try it?

111
00:05:47.081 --> 00:05:48.500
I sure do!

112
00:05:48.501 --> 00:05:50.330
Last one in
is an elephant egg!

113
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.540
Um, elephants
don't lay...

114
00:05:52.541 --> 00:05:54.500
<i> Twende Kiboko!</i>
...eggs! (SQUAWKS)

115
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.830
(ALL LAUGHING)

116
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.120
Come on, everyone!
The water's <i> poa!</i>

117
00:06:00.121 --> 00:06:02.210
Or do you wanna
be elephant eggs?

118
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:03.290
Not me!

119
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.040
Hmm. I usually just wade.
But it might be relaxing.

120
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.880
Oh. Strange.
But... nice!

121
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.380
Whoa! This water
won't let you sink!

122
00:06:20.381 --> 00:06:23.500
Seriously, Fuli,
this is water
even you would like!

123
00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.670
Thanks,
but no thanks.

124
00:06:25.671 --> 00:06:28.790
Besides, somebody's got
to get that Tuliza for Kion.

125
00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.460
Yep.

126
00:06:30.461 --> 00:06:32.080
No. I'll go.

127
00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.670
I'm the fastest.

128
00:06:33.671 --> 00:06:35.170
You're the keenest
of sight.

129
00:06:35.171 --> 00:06:37.620
I need you to stay
and watch for danger.

130
00:06:37.621 --> 00:06:40.540
Come on! What could happen
at the Great Bunga Sea?

131
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.540
Well, Kion could float away.

132
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.170
BUNGA: <i> Zuka Zama!</i>

133
00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:51.120
Wow! Kion,
you really are relaxed!

134
00:06:51.121 --> 00:06:52.460
Aah.

135
00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.830
So, how do I
get to the Tuliza?

136
00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:57.040
It's under the tree.
On top of that mesa.

137
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:03.920
Just beyond
the rock formations?

138
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.620
It's the only tree around!

139
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.710
Only tree around.
I think I can find it.
<i>Huwezi!</i>

(CHORUS SINGS
IN NATIVE LANGUAGE)

141
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.420
Now that's what
I call relaxed.

142
00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.330
Ah! Feels so good
to really run again!

143
00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.540

144
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.000
(GASPS) Whoops.

145
00:07:27.001 --> 00:07:28.540
Huh. Spoke too soon.

146
00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:33.460
Ah. This is better.

147
00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.210
Argh! Seriously?

148
00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.540
Ugh. These canyons
all look the same!

149
00:07:49.541 --> 00:07:52.580
And now I can't see
the mesa or the tree!

150
00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:57.540
MALE VOICE: Well, well.
Looks like we have
a little lost cheetah.

151
00:07:57.541 --> 00:07:59.080
Who's there?

152
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.750
Mmm. This is nice.

153
00:08:05.751 --> 00:08:08.580
Indeed. I could
get used to this

154
00:08:08.581 --> 00:08:10.750
if we didn't need to get
to the Tree of Life.

155
00:08:10.751 --> 00:08:12.210
The Tree of Who?

156
00:08:12.211 --> 00:08:15.120
The Tree of Life.
Don't forget
we've got a mission.

157
00:08:15.121 --> 00:08:18.500
Yeah. But this is the best
I've felt in days.

158
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:20.500
So peaceful.

159
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:24.040
Yeah, it is peaceful.

160
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Wait a second.
What's that?

161
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.080
Uh-oh.

162
00:08:31.081 --> 00:08:33.540
Guys! Feathers!
Beaks! Pink!

163
00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.710
Huh?
Flamingos!

164
00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:38.080
(FLAMINOGS SQUAWKING)

165
00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.670
Guys? What's going on?

166
00:08:45.671 --> 00:08:48.120
Um...
This is not good.

167
00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.880
Who are you?
Show yourself!

168
00:08:50.881 --> 00:08:52.790
Orders? (LAUGHS)

169
00:08:52.791 --> 00:08:55.790
You are in no position
to give orders.

170
00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.880
Oh, you're a cheetah.

171
00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:02.170
(SCOFFS)
There is no fooling you!
(CHUCKLES)

172
00:09:02.171 --> 00:09:04.080
My name is Azaad.

173
00:09:04.081 --> 00:09:06.540
And you are in my territory.

174
00:09:06.541 --> 00:09:08.670
This is a problem.

175
00:09:08.671 --> 00:09:11.750
These canyons are
not big enough
for two cheetahs.

176
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:14.580
If you want to leave,
it's fine by me.

177
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.580
You invade my territory.

178
00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:20.620
My territory!
And then you make jokes?

179
00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.920
Listen. I'm sorry I stepped

in his own territory.

But still,
you could have won the race.

371
00:17:43.831 --> 00:17:46.000
You could have beaten Azaad.

373
00:17:48.001 --> 00:17:51.000

You are a most
remarkable cheetah, Fuli.

Azaad would be very happy
to have you as

the Tuliza that you need.

to your friends together.

this means that
