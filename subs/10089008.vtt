Making the hippo lanes
after a big rainstorm

6
00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:14.919
has been a hippo tradition
for a long time.

7
00:01:14.961 --> 00:01:17.871
It sure would be easy
to get lost
in all these reeds.

8
00:01:17.871 --> 00:01:19.380
Exactly.

9
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.500
Flattening all
these overgrown plants

10
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.209
helps everyone else cross
the flood plains safely.

11
00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:27.119
So I try to make 'em
straight and true.

12
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.540
And that's what they are,
straight and true.

13
00:01:30.581 --> 00:01:35.541
I do my best.
And someday you'll be the one
making the hippo lanes!

14
00:01:35.541 --> 00:01:39.379
Help! Help! I'm stuck!

15
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.960
It came from back this way!

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.960

25
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.040
They'll never find
him in this mess.

26
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.290
This way, Dad!

27
00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.789
Hey!
Stay away from him, Makuu!

28
00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.080
(GASPS) Makuu?

29
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.210
Think about it, Beshte.

30
00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.540
There's two of us,
and only one of you.

31
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.960
Back off, Makuu.

32
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.709
The flood plains
are a safe zone
after a rainstorm.

33
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.080
You know
Beshte's right, Makuu.

34
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.500
Hippos...
Always obeying the rules.

35
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.830
Come on.
One little rhino's
not worth the effort.

36
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.290
You sure they're gone?

37
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.960
Yup. So what's
the kerbubble?

38
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.500
I got tangled up
in the reeds and mud.

39
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.579
And I can't get free.

40
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.960
Well, maybe you should
have waited for me
to finish the hippo lanes.

41
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.830
Just like all
the other animals.

42
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.290
But I was in a hurry!

43
00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.210
(SIGHS) I know.
I should have waited.

44
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.079
Don't worry.
We'll get you out.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.380

(GASPS) I'm free!
Oh, oh, thank you!

50
00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.330
Don't forget...
I know!

51
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.330
Wait to cross until
the hippo lanes are done.

52
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.750
That's right.

53
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:22.879
Won't be long now.

54
00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:24.459
Hey, Beshte!

55
00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:25.619
Kion!

56
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.580
We heard an animal
shouting for help.

57
00:03:27.621 --> 00:03:31.371
Yeah. But it's
taking us forever to get
through all this muck.

58
00:03:31.371 --> 00:03:32.960
Don't worry about that.

59
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.999
Me and my dad saved
the little guy.

60
00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:36.289
And scared off Makuu.

61
00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:39.169
You and your dad did all that?

62
00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.880
Maybe Basi should be on
the Lion Guard too, Kion.

63
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.750
(CHUCKLING)
I don't think so.

64
00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.459
I've got my jaws full
making the hippo lanes.

65
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.500
And speaking
of the hippo lanes,
I need to get back to it!

67
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.880
Whoa! You okay, Dad?

68
00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:58.001
I'll be fine, Beshte.
That little rhino just
scratched me with his horn.

00:03:58.001 --> 00:04:00.709
(GRUNTING)

70
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.500
Dad?
Looks like more
than just a scratch.

71
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.880
Basi, you probably
shouldn't be walking
on that leg.

72
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.000
I'm afraid
the hippo lanes can't wait.

(GRUNTS)

74
00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:12.749
Dad, there's no way
you can make the hippo lanes

75
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.580
if you're having trouble
just walking.

76
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.080
(SIGHS) I'm afraid
you're right.

77
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.120
So? What's the big deal?

78
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.790
The flood plains
will dry up soon.

79
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.459
There's not
a cloud in the sky.

the weather on the savannah,

84
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.290
just wait a few breaths.

85
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.789
Beshte? It looks
like someday is today.

86
00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.330
What do you mean?

87
00:04:39.371 --> 00:04:42.791
I've always said
you'd take over
the hippo lanes someday.

88
00:04:42.791 --> 00:04:45.460
But today? Right now?

89
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.749
Dad, I don't know
if I can do it.

90
00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:50.579
The Pride Lands need
those hippo lanes, son.

91
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.500
And I know you can do it.

92
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.540
Beshte,
you're the strongest
in the Pride Lands.

93
00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.000
We all believe in you.

94
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.119
Right. It's my responsibility
as a hippo.

95
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.880
(INHALES)
I'll do it.

96
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.460
That's great.
All right!

97
00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.290
That's my boy.

98
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.960
And I can help!

99
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.000
(GRUNTING)

100
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.669
It's really stuck in there.

101
00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:13.419
Come on, Bunga.

102
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.830
Something tells me
we'd only slow Beshte down.

103
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.880
And you know
I'm never one
to slow anyone down!

104
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.460
Thanks, guys.

105
00:05:20.501 --> 00:05:23.081
We'll help your dad
get back to solid ground
so he can rest.

106
00:05:23.081 --> 00:05:25.249
(GRUNTS) Sounds good to me.

107
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.790
My first time
making the hippo lanes.

108
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.170
What a big day!

109
00:05:34.329 --> 00:05:36.419
Thank you, Lion Guard.

110
00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.829
I'm sure if I stay off it,
it'll heal up quick.

111
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:39.960
Happy to help.

112
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.500
Everyone! Everyone!
We've got a problem.

113
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.000
There's another
rainstorm on the way!

114
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.079
We heard.

115
00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:47.499
It is the rainy season, Ono.

116
00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:50.379
Yes. But the sable antelopes'
grazing grounds

117
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.540
were already flooded out
in yesterday's rainstorm.

118
00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.670
So they've got nowhere to eat?
That's horrible!

119
00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.380
(SIGHS) And if I know
the sable antelope,

120
00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.709
they're probably
too stubborn to move.

121
00:06:01.751 --> 00:06:05.001
Exactly!
They're just standing around
in knee-deep water!

122
00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:07.120
Even the little
baby antelopes!

123
00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.040
So when the next
rain storm comes...

124
00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.379
They'll be completely
underwater.

125
00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:13.379
We need to get that herd
to higher ground.

126
00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.830
You should bring them here.

127
00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.880
The herd's on the other side
of the flood plains.

128
00:06:17.921 --> 00:06:21.621
Well, sure.
But by the time you go around
and lead them back,

129
00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:23.749
Beshte will be done
with the hippo lanes.

130
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:27.500
Right.
Then they can get across
the flood plains quickly.

131
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.750
Before the rain gets here.

132
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.460
Great idea, Basi.
Thanks for your help!

133
00:06:31.501 --> 00:06:34.871
Sure. Just wish I could be
out helping Beshte
with those lanes.

134
00:06:34.871 --> 00:06:36.579
Don't worry, Bigger B.

135
00:06:36.579 --> 00:06:38.619
I know Big B
can handle it.

136
00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.580
Come on, Lion Guard.
Let's go help those antelope!

137
00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.420
Till the Pride Lands end...

138
00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.670

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:51.790
Hi, Beshte!

Hey, Laini.

141
00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.750
Check it!
I'm makin' the hippo lanes!

142
00:06:55.791 --> 00:06:59.421
Oh, good! I've been trying
to get across
the flood plains all day!

143
00:06:59.421 --> 00:07:01.999
Think I could hitch a ride
to Ndefu Grove?

144
00:07:02.041 --> 00:07:05.581
Sure! Helpin' other animals
is the whole point
of the hippo lanes!

145
00:07:05.581 --> 00:07:07.580
Aw! Thanks, Beshte.

146
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.330

What is it with you?

177
00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.210
You just told us
to follow you.

178
00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:34.500
Anyone hurt?

179
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:35.879
Nope.
Fine.

180
00:08:35.879 --> 00:08:37.999
Ono, how's the herd?
They look fine.

181
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.880
But there's no way
they can get past those rocks.

182
00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.750
Is there another way around?

183
00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:45.330
I don't see one.

184
00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.750
And it looks like
the storm's coming in fast!

185
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:50.249
(SIGHS) Too bad Beshte's
not here.

186
00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:52.250
He could move
those boulders easy.

187
00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:53.460
We don't need Beshte.

188
00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.960
Kion can just Roar
that rock away.

189
00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.500
Right, Kion?

190
00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.750
I could,
if the antelopes weren't
on the other side of it.

191
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.539
Oh, yeah.

192
00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:06.330
But I can use the Roar
from that side of the rock!

193
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:07.330
Come on!

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:18.080
Excellent work, Beshte.

196
00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.620
I didn't think
he was going to make that one.

197
00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.170
What are you talking about?

198
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:24.669
He's Beshte!
Strongest in the Pride Lands.

199
00:09:24.669 --> 00:09:25.879
I suppose.

200
00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.880
But I was afraid we were
going to get stuck.

201
00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:29.920
Don't listen to her.

202
00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.960
You're doing a dandy job.

203
00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.790
Heh-heh. Thanks, Chura.

204
00:09:36.209 --> 00:09:38.999
Except I was headed that way.

205
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.580
No problem.
I'll get you there in a jiffy.

206
00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.670
Oh. Then can you drop me off
over by Ndefu Grove?

207
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:47.959
Sure thing, Laini.

208
00:09:47.959 --> 00:09:49.039
You sure you don't mind?

209
00:09:49.039 --> 00:09:50.499

with the hippo lanes?

by all the rides I was giving.

straight and true at all!

311

they're kind of pretty.

looks like a flamingo.

Yeah.

315
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.170
Wait. But hippo lanes aren't
supposed to be pretty.

316
00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:03.379
Hippos lanes should be
straight and true.

And useful!

318
00:14:04.961 --> 00:14:08.661

we just led a whole herd
of sable antelopes to them.

the flood plains now,
they'll get totally lost!

so disappointed.

how to fix this!

They're not exactly
straight and true.

they're more like a bunch
