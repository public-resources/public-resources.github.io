Help!
Help!

7
00:01:09.291 --> 00:01:10.420
That's Tiifu and Zuri.

8
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.080
Sounds like
they're in trouble.

9
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.000
Ono? See anything?

10
00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:16.750
Negative. The calls are coming
from inside Pride Rock.

11
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.420
Let's check it out. Come on.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.000
(TIIFU AND ZURI WAILING)

13
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.500
Tiifu, Zuri. What's wrong?

14
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.460
What's wrong? Look at us.

15
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.170
Our fur won't lay straight.

16
00:01:27.171 --> 00:01:29.170
It's too hot
and dry around here.

17
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.790
Well, it is the dry season.

18
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.420
But it's not just our fur.

19
00:01:34.421 --> 00:01:37.420
Our paws are cracked,
our noses are scaly.

20
00:01:37.421 --> 00:01:38.920
We look horrible.

21
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.170
Seriously?

22
00:01:40.171 --> 00:01:41.460
KIARA: Oh, no.

23
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.170
I told you two not to call
the Lion Guard for this.

24
00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:46.710
But, Kiara...
Ladies.

25
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.170
The Guard is only
for real emergencies.

26
00:01:50.171 --> 00:01:51.960
Not fur emergencies.

27
00:01:51.961 --> 00:01:53.120
Understand?

28
00:01:53.121 --> 00:01:54.170
Sorry.

29
00:01:54.171 --> 00:01:55.620
Yes, Your Majesty.

30
00:01:55.621 --> 00:01:58.670
Maybe you should try
the warm mud pots at
the edge of the Pride Lands.

31
00:01:58.671 --> 00:02:00.960
Us hippos love 'em
when the weather's too dry.

32
00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:03.000
Mud can be very moisturizing.

33
00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:04.210
That's perfect.

34
00:02:04.211 --> 00:02:05.960
We'll go to the mud pots.

35
00:02:05.961 --> 00:02:07.620
You have to come, too, Kiara.

36
00:02:07.621 --> 00:02:09.380
We never see you anymore.

37
00:02:09.381 --> 00:02:10.830
Yeah. You're always so busy

38
00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:12.790
with boring
Royal Family stuff.

39
00:02:12.791 --> 00:02:15.040
"Boring Royal Family stuff"?

40
00:02:15.041 --> 00:02:18.290
Like helping the Pride Landers
deal with the threat of Scar?

41
00:02:18.291 --> 00:02:20.880
Exactly.
And it'd be good
for you, Kiara.

42
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.170
I didn't want to say it,
but you're looking
a little frizzy yourself.

43
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.830
Mom?

44
00:02:27.831 --> 00:02:30.040
The edge of the Pride Lands
isn't as safe
as it used to be.

45
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.670
But if you had an escort
from the Lion Guard...

46
00:02:32.671 --> 00:02:34.920
I'd be happy to take Kiara
to the mud pots.

47
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.250
No one'll keep her
safer than me.

48
00:02:37.251 --> 00:02:40.170
I was thinking
more about Kion.

49
00:02:40.171 --> 00:02:42.500
Kion can come too.
That'll make it more fun.

50
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.210
We wouldn't be going
to have fun, Bunga.

51
00:02:45.211 --> 00:02:48.250
But you'd definitely be safer
with two Lion Guard members.

52
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.500
I'll go.
Thanks, Kion.

53
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.420

56
00:02:55.421 --> 00:02:56.920
keep up the daily patrol.

57
00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.380
Looks like Bunga and I
are going
on a Girls' Day Away.

58
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.170
Better you than me.

60
00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.080
Ew! Don't get us muddy.

61
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.250
Why not? I thought you
wanted to get muddy.

62
00:03:13.251 --> 00:03:14.250
Not like that.

63
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.750
We came to relax in the mud,

64
00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:18.120
not splash around.

65
00:03:18.121 --> 00:03:19.460
But splashing's more fun.

66
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.750
Look.

67
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.920

00:03:25.381 --> 00:03:26.420
We're here to keep watch.

70
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.460
Okay, I'll keep watch.

72
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.540

73
00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.620
Gotcha.

Why do boys like to be
so messy?

77
00:03:41.211 --> 00:03:42.250
Messy can be fun.

78
00:03:42.251 --> 00:03:43.790
Mmm, I don't think so.

79
00:03:43.791 --> 00:03:46.790
Relaxing and
pampering ourselves is fun.

80

Kion said we were safe.
Why did you run?

192
00:08:31.671 --> 00:08:33.580
I'm sorry. It's just...

193
00:08:33.581 --> 00:08:35.540
I'm afraid of the dark.

194
00:08:35.541 --> 00:08:37.830

the extra dirt in here,

of the dark at home.

hiding in the shadows.

212
00:09:07.961 --> 00:09:10.460
Yeah. But maybe
you could have just told us

213
00:09:10.461 --> 00:09:12.380
instead of blocking
our only way out.

Don't worry.
We'll find another way out.

216

We just need to
figure out which one
of these tunnels to try.

217

it's probably gonna
get darker
before it gets lighter.

right there with you.

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:55.040
The surface of what?

364
00:14:55.041 --> 00:14:56.960
That's gotta be
the way he came in.

365
00:14:56.961 --> 00:14:59.250
Let's go. <i>Zuka Zama!</i>

366
00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:01.250
Bunga. Wait for us.

367
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.960
Come on. We'll help you
get back
to the Pride Lands too.

368
00:15:04.961 --> 00:15:06.620
Oh, goody.

369
00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:09.580
So, where are we now?

370
00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:13.080
Nothin' to fear down here.

371
00:15:13.081 --> 00:15:14.920
Nothin' to fear down here.

372
00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.330
If the zebra came in this way,

373
00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:19.960
shouldn't we be out by now?

374
00:15:19.961 --> 00:15:21.250
Relax, Tiifu.

375
00:15:21.251 --> 00:15:23.080
I'm sure it won't be
much longer.

376
00:15:23.081 --> 00:15:24.080
Uh...

377
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.000
(SIGHS) Great.

378
00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:30.790
Now where do we go?

379
00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.170
Any chance you remember
which one of those tunnels
you came down?

380
00:15:35.171 --> 00:15:36.620
Well, of course.

381
00:15:36.621 --> 00:15:38.080
It was that one.

382
00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:41.620
Hmm.

383
00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:42.880
(STRUGGLING)

384
00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.380
This didn't happen last time.

385
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.540
That zebra has no idea
where he's going.

386
00:15:48.541 --> 00:15:50.830
He doesn't even know
where he's been.

387
00:15:50.831 --> 00:15:52.960
Kion. We gotta
get out of here.

388
00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:55.040
Of course.

389
00:15:55.041 --> 00:15:56.120
Muhangus.

390
00:15:56.121 --> 00:15:57.290
Huh?
What about him?

391
00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:59.000
We came in through his den.

392
00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:01.000
He's got to be
down here somewhere.

393
00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:03.460
If we can find him,
he can lead us out.

394
00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.120
Ready for some tracking?

395
00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:06.670
When am I not?

396
00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:11.210
(BOTH SNIFFING)

397
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.290
That can't be comfortable.

398
00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:15.040
How about I get you unstuck?

399
00:16:15.041 --> 00:16:16.790
Someone's stuck?

400
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.380
How dreadful.

401
00:16:18.381 --> 00:16:19.790
Not for long.

402
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.920
KIARA: Kion. I've got it.

403
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:24.250
(BOTH SNIFFING)

404
00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:27.540
I smell it too.

405
00:16:27.541 --> 00:16:29.080
It's faint, but it's there.

406
00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:30.580
Let's go.

407
00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.330
Tiifu, Zuri, come on.

408
00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:35.330
(STRUGGLES) We're coming...

409
00:16:35.331 --> 00:16:36.500
Too.

410
00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:40.170
Oh. That feels so much better.

411
00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:42.000
Come on.

412
00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:47.330
We did it.

413
00:16:47.331 --> 00:16:48.830
We found Muhangus.

414
00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:52.040
Um, looks like a wall to me.

415
00:16:52.041 --> 00:16:54.210
And Muhangus is somewhere
on the other side.

416
00:16:54.211 --> 00:16:56.040
We just have to
dig our way to him.

417
00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:59.380
Ah-ha. Sounds like a job
for a honey badger.

418
00:16:59.381 --> 00:17:00.500
Here we go.

419
00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.290
No! You and Kion can't go.

420
00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:05.080
Tiifu, they have to go.

421
00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:07.040
That's how
they'll get us home.

422
00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:09.460
But what if something happens
and they don't come back?

423
00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:11.250
We'd be stuck here forever.

424
00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:14.380
Tiifu. I promise
that won't happen.

425
00:17:14.381 --> 00:17:15.540
We'll be back.

426
00:17:15.541 --> 00:17:16.920
And in the meantime,

427
00:17:16.921 --> 00:17:19.210
you'll have your best friends
right by your side.

428
00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.040
Oh, yes.

429
00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.210
We'll be right by your side.

430
00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:29.960
(SNORING)

431
00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.380
Ah-ha! One aardvark,
straight ahead.

432
00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:39.380
Nice place.

433
00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.080
Muhangus?

434
00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:42.580
Muhangus?

435
00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:44.420
Nah, I got this.

436
00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:47.250
Wake up!
(GASPING)

437
00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:49.290
You again?

438
00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:51.250
What is it with you two?

439
00:17:51.251 --> 00:17:54.250
You got something against
aardvarks getting some sleep?

440
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:56.920
No. Not at all. We're sorry.

441
00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:00.330
It's just, we got lost
down here with our friends.

442
00:18:00.331 --> 00:18:01.460
We were hoping you could help.

443
00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:05.080
(SCOFFS) Maybe after
I'm done sleeping.

444
00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:08.750
Okay. If that's the way
you want it.

445
00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:10.420
Scoot over.

446
00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.120
Hey. What are you doing?

447
00:18:14.121 --> 00:18:16.460
If you can't get us out,
we'll just move in here.

448
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.080
We'll be den-mates.

449
00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:20.670
(SNORING)

450
00:18:20.671 --> 00:18:22.580
Hey, get out of here.

451
00:18:22.581 --> 00:18:24.670
Shh. After I'm done sleeping.

452
00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.120
(SNORING)

453
00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.710
All right. All right.

454
00:18:29.711 --> 00:18:32.500
If it means gettin'
rid of you, I'll help you.

455
00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:35.290
Shouldn't Kion and Bunga
be back by now?

456
00:18:35.291 --> 00:18:36.960
BUNGA: I don't know.
Should we?

457
00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:39.210
You found him.

458
00:18:39.211 --> 00:18:41.460
Yep. And he's gonna
help us get out of here.

459
00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:45.040
Only because the honey badger
annoyed me into it.

460
00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:48.330
I can be really annoying
when I put my mind to it.

461
00:18:48.331 --> 00:18:49.960
Oh, you got that right.

462
00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:53.620
Does Muhangus even know
where he's going?

463
00:18:53.621 --> 00:18:55.290
We've been walking forever.

464
00:18:55.291 --> 00:18:57.170
I know. I just want
to be home.

465
00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.830
Then I think you'll like
what's up ahead.

466
00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:01.210
Look.
(GASPS)

467
00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:03.540
I see daylight.

468
00:19:03.541 --> 00:19:04.790
We made it.

469
00:19:04.791 --> 00:19:06.380
Sorry. Gotta run.

470
00:19:06.381 --> 00:19:07.380
Hey!

471
00:19:07.381 --> 00:19:08.500
How rude.

472
00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:10.500
Where is she running to?

473
00:19:10.501 --> 00:19:13.380
We were all having
such a lovely time.

474
00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:15.380
Nah, she's just afraid
of the dark.

475
00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:17.330
She didn't like
being trapped down here.

476
00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:21.210
Trapped? All this time
we've been trapped?

477
00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:22.750
In the dark?

478
00:19:22.751 --> 00:19:24.330
Uh-oh.
It's okay.

479
00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:26.330
You don't have to...
Panic and run.

480
00:19:26.331 --> 00:19:27.670
Panic and run!

481
00:19:27.671 --> 00:19:29.210
Stop it. Stop it!

482
00:19:29.211 --> 00:19:30.920
The tunnel will collapse!

483
00:19:30.921 --> 00:19:33.170
Panic and run.
Every animal for himself!

484
00:19:33.171 --> 00:19:35.500
(BOTH SCREAMING)

485
00:19:35.501 --> 00:19:37.830
Panic and run! Panic and run!

486
00:19:37.831 --> 00:19:39.380
KION: You don't have to panic.

487
00:19:39.381 --> 00:19:40.250
I do!

488
00:19:40.251 --> 00:19:43.330
We're trapped and it's dark!

489
00:19:43.331 --> 00:19:45.080
Panic and run. Panic and run.

490
00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:47.000
Wait. Stop.
Panic and run!

491
00:19:47.001 --> 00:19:48.040
BOTH: Tiifu?

492
00:19:48.041 --> 00:19:49.790
Get out of his way.
You'll get hurt.

493
00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.540
It's okay. I can help.

494
00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:53.250
I know what he needs to hear.

495
00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:56.880
It's okay to be scared.

496
00:19:57.290 --> 00:19:58.380
It's scary in the dark.

497
00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:00.710
(STAMMERS) Yes.

498
00:20:00.711 --> 00:20:03.380
It is scary in the dark.

499
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:06.290
I know.
'Cause I was scared too.

500
00:20:06.291 --> 00:20:08.920
And I panicked so much,
I made a tunnel cave in.

501
00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:10.710
You did?

502
00:20:10.711 --> 00:20:12.960
Yeah. But someone taught me

503
00:20:12.961 --> 00:20:14.920
that the dark only seems scary

504
00:20:14.921 --> 00:20:17.250
because we imagine
scary things in it.

505
00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:20.880
I do imagine
scary things in the dark.

506
00:20:20.881 --> 00:20:22.540
Lots of scary things.

507
00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.960
Me too. But they're not real.

508
00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.210
You just need to remember...

509
00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:29.120
"There's nothing to fear
down here."

510
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:32.920
"There's nothing to fear
down here."

511
00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:35.620
Right. And you know
what else helped me?

512
00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.120
My friends stuck with me.

513
00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:39.080
Just like I'm going
to stick with you.

514
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:42.620
Because we're friends?

515
00:20:42.621 --> 00:20:43.670
Exactly.

516
00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:47.420
Best friends?

517
00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:50.330
Sure. Best friends.

518
00:20:50.331 --> 00:20:52.170
Now let's go home. Together.

519
00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:55.420
Wow.

520
00:20:55.421 --> 00:20:57.080
I thought I was
her best friend.

521
00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:00.330
See? We did it. We're home.

522
00:21:00.331 --> 00:21:03.170
And I've got
a new best friend.

523
00:21:03.171 --> 00:21:05.250
Wait till I tell the herd.

524
00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.290
You were amazing, Tiifu.

525
00:21:09.291 --> 00:21:10.420
Definitely.

526
00:21:10.421 --> 00:21:11.330
You saved the day.

527
00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.500
I just knew
how the zebra felt.

528
00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:15.500
But, it's funny.

529
00:21:15.501 --> 00:21:16.670
When I was helping him?

530
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.380
I wasn't scared at all.

531
00:21:18.381 --> 00:21:20.460
ONO: Kion! Bunga!
There you are!

532
00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:23.120
We just put out the fire
by the mud pots.

533
00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:25.290
We were so worried
when we didn't see you guys.

534
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:26.960
Are you okay?

535
00:21:26.961 --> 00:21:28.000
We're fine.

536
00:21:28.001 --> 00:21:29.670
But the fire was huge.

537
00:21:29.671 --> 00:21:30.790
How did you get away?

538
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.290
It's kind of a long story.

539
00:21:33.291 --> 00:21:36.330
Yeah. With a mole,
an aardvark and a zebra in it.

540
00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:39.670
You mean that zebra?

541
00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:42.830
Ooh. I wonder what's in here?

542
00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:46.120
THURSTON: Help! Help!

543
00:21:46.121 --> 00:21:48.120
It's dark and I'm trapped!

544
00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:50.460
It's okay. I've got this.

545
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.170
Don't panic, zebra.

546
00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:55.500
Your best friend's
coming to get you.

547
00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:58.330
TIIFU: There's nothing
to fear down here.

548
00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.420
(CHORUS VOCALIZING)

549
00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:28.920

Here comes the Lion Guard ♪</i>
