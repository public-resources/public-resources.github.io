We volunteered
to deliver his really
important message.

360
00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:05.960
And then
we failed miserably.

361
00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.120

home and tell him.

364
00:14:14.079 --> 00:14:16.289
I never want to let
down my dad either.

I'm here.

do something to
make it easier.

Well, you did face down
a ferocious forest hog.

369
00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:27.709
That's almost as hard
as facing our dad.

370
00:14:27.751 --> 00:14:30.421
And it seemed like
the sort of thing
a prince would do.

We don't exactly
feel like princes yet...

Trust me. If you act
like a prince,

373
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:38.790
sooner or later,
you'll start to
feel like a prince.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:13.329
Not at all.

538
00:21:13.329 --> 00:21:16.119
In fact,
it's perfect.

539
00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:18.920
KION: And, so...

540
00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.420
Here we are.

541
00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:24.330
And did you bring back
King Sokwe's message?

542
00:21:25.079 --> 00:21:26.749
Uh, yeah...

543
00:21:26.749 --> 00:21:28.169
Well, then?

544
00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:29.500
It's just...

545
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.580
Kion? I need
the message.

546
00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:32.920
Are you sure?

547
00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.580
Yes! You have to
give it to me!

548
00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:36.000
Okay...

549
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.419
<i>Kuishi ni kucheka!</i>

550
00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:42.170
(GRUNTS)

551
00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:44.500
Sorry, Your Majesty.

552
00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:46.000
It really wasn't my idea.

553
00:21:46.041 --> 00:21:48.251
(SING-SONG VOICE)
This might have
been a mistake.

554
00:21:49.289 --> 00:21:50.749
(CHUCKLES)

555
00:21:50.749 --> 00:21:52.919
Oh, King Sokwe.

556
00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:55.540
No one delivers
a peace message
like him.

557
00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:57.830
(ALL LAUGHING)

558
00:22:01.459 --> 00:22:03.499
(CHORUS VOCALIZING)

559
00:22:26.919 --> 00:22:28.789

Here comes the Lion Guard ♪</i>
