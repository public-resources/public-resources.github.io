00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.120
(NARRATOR READING)

3
00:01:00.121 --> 00:01:02.250
NARRATOR:
"Journey of Memories."

4
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.750
MAKINI:
Look! The Tree of Life!

5
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.580
This is the next
<i> moja kwa moja</i> stone,
all right.

6
00:01:12.581 --> 00:01:15.170
Then we're still
on the right path
to the Tree of Life.

7
00:01:15.171 --> 00:01:17.540
But that painting
shows a river.

8
00:01:17.541 --> 00:01:20.000
You call this a river?

9
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:22.420
It might have been
a big river at some point.

10
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.000
Landscapes can
change over time
or with the seasons.

11
00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:27.790
Just like the dry season
back home.

12
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.830
Ono, what's the
next landmark?

13
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.580
<i> Nawaza...</i>

14
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.460
<i> It's a pool of water.
 With rocks all around it.</i>

15
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.210
Anga?
Yep.

16
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.250
Oh! I remember
this river now.

17
00:01:43.251 --> 00:01:45.620
I was here
with my mom and dad
when I was little.

18
00:01:45.621 --> 00:01:47.540
On my first trip
to the Tree of Life.

19
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.120
It had a lot more water
back then.

20
00:01:51.121 --> 00:01:54.460
Well, any river
I can hop across
has enough water for me.

21
00:01:54.461 --> 00:01:57.120
So, Makini,
was Rafiki here with you too?

22
00:01:57.121 --> 00:01:58.580
Nope.

23
00:01:58.581 --> 00:02:01.290
My mom and dad were
taking me to the Tree of Life
to meet Rafiki.

24
00:02:01.291 --> 00:02:02.830
We had so much fun!

25
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.620
Ooh! Cold! Cold! Cold!

26
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.290
(GRUNTS)

27
00:02:11.291 --> 00:02:14.120
(SHIVERING)
You're right, Makini!
This water's freezing!

28
00:02:14.121 --> 00:02:15.580
(LAUGHS) Dad!

29
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.540
Oh, Kitendo, my love.
(CHUCKLES)

30
00:02:18.541 --> 00:02:19.790
You know the saying.

31
00:02:19.791 --> 00:02:22.080
"Test the water
before diving in."

32
00:02:22.081 --> 00:02:24.170
(CHUCKLES)
But then again...

33
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.170
(GASPING)

34
00:02:26.171 --> 00:02:27.830
"If you want
to take a bath,

35
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.040
"you should not be afraid
to get cold."

36
00:02:31.041 --> 00:02:33.290
As usual,
you are right, Fikiri.

37
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.080
But my way is way more fun!

38
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.580
(ALL LAUGH)

39
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:43.880
FULI: Makini!

40
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.000
Oops. Sorry, Fuli.

41
00:02:46.001 --> 00:02:48.080
BUNGA: <i> Zuka Zama!</i>

42
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.830
Careful, Bunga!
You know the saying,

43
00:02:50.831 --> 00:02:52.920
"Test the water
before diving in!"

44
00:02:52.921 --> 00:02:54.960
(SCOFFS)
Where's the fun in that?

45
00:02:54.961 --> 00:02:57.170
(CHUCKLES)
You sound like my dad.

46
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.670
Hey, Anga!
You find the next
<i>moja kwa moja</i> stone?

47
00:03:01.671 --> 00:03:04.290
I found a rocky pool
with small boulders.

48
00:03:04.291 --> 00:03:05.500
But it's dry.

49
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:07.670
Oh. That doesn't
seem right.

50
00:03:07.671 --> 00:03:10.040
The pool I remember
had lots of water.

51
00:03:10.041 --> 00:03:11.750
And the boulders
were huge!

52
00:03:11.751 --> 00:03:14.380
It matches
Ono's description.
It's just...

53
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:15.960
Drier.

54
00:03:15.961 --> 00:03:17.880
Well, if this river
has less water,

55
00:03:17.881 --> 00:03:20.330
it makes sense
that the pool
would be dry, too.

56
00:03:20.331 --> 00:03:23.040
Wait! I remember
those trees!

57
00:03:23.041 --> 00:03:25.540
There's a waterfall
down there! It's amazing!

58
00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.620
Uh, that's the opposite
direction of the pool.

59
00:03:28.621 --> 00:03:30.790
But it's so beautiful!

60
00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:33.040
Can we go, Kion?
Please?

61
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.210
Well, I guess a little detour
out of our way would be okay.

62
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.670
Lead on, Makini!

63
00:03:38.671 --> 00:03:40.040
(WHOOPING)

64
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.170
MAKINI: Uh, right
around this corner.

65
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.500
(GASPS) We're here!
This is it!

66
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.170
Or was it?

67
00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.040
Uh, am I just
not seeing it?

68
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.920
Well, it used to be here.

69
00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:56.290
Water was pouring
down this rock.

70
00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.960
(GASPS) Oh, look! See?

71
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.620
I wouldn't
call that pouring.

72
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.460
Look!
One of Rafiki's paintings.

73
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.670
That wasn't here last time.

74
00:04:06.671 --> 00:04:09.080
I wonder if it's
<i> a moja kwa moja</i> stone.

75
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.750
Nope. No Tree of Life.

76
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.040
But now we know
this used to be a waterfall.

77
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.920
Maybe Rafiki
saw the waterfall

78
00:04:17.921 --> 00:04:19.920
on his trip
to the Tree of Life

79
00:04:19.921 --> 00:04:21.920
and painted it
just because it was <i> poa.</i>

80
00:04:21.921 --> 00:04:23.080
That makes sense.

81
00:04:23.081 --> 00:04:25.000
He paints things
all the time
in the Pride Lands.

82
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.250
So, the next
<i> moja kwa moja</i> stone
is this way.

83
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.040
KION: Let's go, everyone.

84
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.960
Did you see the waterfall
with your mom and dad too?

85
00:04:33.961 --> 00:04:37.920
Yeah! I saw so many
amazing things on our trip
to the Tree of Life!

86
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.420
Oh! I remember
something really fun
down that way! Come on!

87
00:04:42.421 --> 00:04:44.250
Makini?
Where are you going now?

88
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.000
See this rock?

89
00:04:46.001 --> 00:04:48.620
It has a big hole
near the bottom that you can
stick your arm through!

90
00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:50.120
I wanna try! I wanna try!

91
00:04:50.121 --> 00:04:51.330
So, where's the hole?

92
00:04:51.331 --> 00:04:52.540
Think I can get
my head in it?

93
00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.920
I don't see it.

94
00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.500
I was sure
this was the rock.

95
00:04:57.501 --> 00:04:59.170
But maybe it's not.

96
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.960
Sorry, Makini,
but we have to keep moving.

97
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.960
(GROANS)
Lousy rock with no hole!

98
00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:10.460
Ow!

99
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.080
Okay. So maybe
that wasn't the right rock.

100
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.250
(GASPS)
But there is something

101
00:05:19.251 --> 00:05:20.960
really amazing
right over there!

102
00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:22.460
Seriously?

103
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.210
So, what are we
looking at?

104
00:05:26.211 --> 00:05:27.790
That mountain right there!

105
00:05:27.791 --> 00:05:29.790
The one that looks
like a monkey's face!

106
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:31.960
Don't see it.

107
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.380
Hmm... We might
have to get lower.

108
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.380
And tilt
our heads a little.

109
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.080
It doesn't look
like anything at all.

110
00:05:43.081 --> 00:05:44.830
Can we go now?
Good idea.

111
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:47.710
Sorry, Makini.

112
00:05:47.711 --> 00:05:50.040
Maybe you're remembering
a different mountain.

113
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.040
Here we are.

114
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.380
Finally.

115
00:06:02.381 --> 00:06:04.170
Yes! This is it!

116
00:06:04.171 --> 00:06:06.210
And it looks just
the way I remember it.

117
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:08.880
Except there's no water.

118
00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.710
And I thought
the boulders were bigger.

119
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.250
Maybe you were smaller?

120
00:06:12.251 --> 00:06:13.420
Oh, yeah.

121
00:06:13.421 --> 00:06:16.040
This painting matches
what I saw on Rafiki's map.

122
00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:17.040
Makini?

123
00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.750
Yep. That's
a <i> moja kwa moja</i> stone.

124
00:06:23.751 --> 00:06:25.120
Ono, what's next?

125
00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:26.880
<i> Nawaza.</i>

126
00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.250
<i> The next landmark
 is four white flowers
 in the shape of a diamond.</i>

127
00:06:32.251 --> 00:06:34.540
They're in a field
of smaller white flowers.

128
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.620
Anga?
Yep.

129
00:06:36.621 --> 00:06:37.920
<i> Anga lenga!</i>

130
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.210
I don't remember
any white flowers,

131
00:06:41.211 --> 00:06:42.920
but I do remember
a really amazing...

132
00:06:42.921 --> 00:06:44.000
ALL: No!

133
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.080
Sorry, Makini.
But no more detours.

134
00:06:48.081 --> 00:06:49.500
We need to keep moving.

135
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:50.880
(SIGHS)

136
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.540
Don't be sad, Makini.

137
00:06:54.541 --> 00:06:56.250
Your detours
are really fun.

138
00:06:56.251 --> 00:06:57.620
Thanks, Beshte.

139
00:06:57.621 --> 00:07:00.580
I had a lot of fun
with my mom and dad
the last time I was here.

140
00:07:00.581 --> 00:07:04.830
In fact, this is where
they first told me
I might be a Royal Mjuzi.

141
00:07:04.831 --> 00:07:07.420
Really? <i> Poa.</i>

142
00:07:07.421 --> 00:07:09.830
Yeah. It was <i> poa.</i>

143
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:13.920
FIKIRI:
Time to go, Makini!

144
00:07:13.921 --> 00:07:16.580
(MAKINI LAUGHS)
KITENDO:
Makini, wrong way!

145
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.960
Rafiki should make paintings

146
00:07:18.961 --> 00:07:21.040
that mark the way
to the Tree of Life.

147
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:22.830
(LAUGHING)

148
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:24.330
Whoa!

149
00:07:24.331 --> 00:07:26.790
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

150
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.540
(SIGHS)

151
00:07:28.541 --> 00:07:30.620
Well, that way does
look more fun, doesn't it?

152
00:07:30.621 --> 00:07:32.120
(LAUGHS) Yeah!

153
00:07:32.121 --> 00:07:35.460
But this is the way
we must go to get
to the Tree of Life.

154
00:07:35.461 --> 00:07:36.670
Why?

155
00:07:36.671 --> 00:07:39.040
Because Rafiki
would like to meet you.

156
00:07:39.041 --> 00:07:42.670
Why?
Rafiki is a Royal Mjuzi.

157
00:07:42.671 --> 00:07:46.290
And he believes
that you may also grow up
to be a Royal Mjuzi.

158
00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.380
But only the
Voices of the Past
at the Tree of Life

159
00:07:49.381 --> 00:07:50.710
will let him know
for sure.

160
00:07:50.711 --> 00:07:52.330
Oh!

161
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:54.250
But... But why me?

162
00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.040
Because you're wise
like your mother.

163
00:07:57.041 --> 00:08:00.330
Or because you're curious
and fun like your father.

164
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:03.540
But mainly,
because you are you.

165
00:08:03.541 --> 00:08:04.670
(GIGGLES)

166
00:08:04.671 --> 00:08:07.880
But no matter what,
you'll always be
our Makini.

167
00:08:07.881 --> 00:08:09.960
And we'll always
be with you.

168
00:08:09.961 --> 00:08:11.710
Until you're ready
to go out on your own.

169
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:15.960
KION: Anga! You find
the white flowers?

170
00:08:15.961 --> 00:08:17.120
Nope.

171
00:08:17.121 --> 00:08:18.830
Great! Then let's...

172
00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:20.170
Wait, what?

173
00:08:20.171 --> 00:08:21.830
No sign of white flowers.

174
00:08:21.831 --> 00:08:23.670
Or anywhere
flowers would grow.

175
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.460
So, what did you see?

Oh! I remember the desert!

178
00:08:29.171 --> 00:08:31.790
We have to cross it.
And head toward the cliffs.

179
00:08:31.791 --> 00:08:33.210
I didn't see any cliffs.

180
00:08:33.211 --> 00:08:35.830
There aren't any cliffs
in Rafiki's painting either.

181
00:08:35.831 --> 00:08:37.420
Just the field of flowers.

182
00:08:37.421 --> 00:08:40.290
But the river, waterfall
and pool are all dried up.

183
00:08:40.291 --> 00:08:43.120
Maybe there used
to be flowers here
when there was water.

184
00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.040
I don't remember flowers.

185
00:08:45.041 --> 00:08:47.380
But I definitely
remember the desert.

186
00:08:47.381 --> 00:08:50.750
We walked
all the way across it
until we reached the cliffs.

haven't exactly
been reliable so far.

can't find the next

we can't find
the Tree of Life.

Makini is the only
one of us who's been
to the Tree of Life before.

191
00:09:04.961 --> 00:09:06.750
Isn't that why Rafiki
sent her with us?

192
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.420
Okay, Makini.

I never thought a step forward
could make so much noise.

So, Makini,

393
00:18:25.501 --> 00:18:26.790
"As you move forward..."

394
00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:29.120
"Don't forget to look back."

395
00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:33.380
Hey, Makini. You okay?

396
00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:35.790
My mom says,

397
00:18:35.791 --> 00:18:38.330
"As you move forward,
don't forget to look back."

398
00:18:38.331 --> 00:18:39.790
But when I do look back,

399
00:18:39.791 --> 00:18:41.620
I'm not remembering
things right.

400
00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:43.460
I feel like
I'm letting Kion down.

401
00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:45.460
You know what
my dad always says.

402
00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:48.500
"The water is always cleaner
at the front of the hippo."

403
00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.830
You gotta leave
those mistakes behind you.

404
00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.620
We all know
you're doing your best.

405
00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:54.830
The last time you were here,
you were real little.

406
00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:57.170
A lot of things
have changed since then.

407
00:18:57.171 --> 00:18:58.250
KION: Beshte's right.

408
00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.710
It's not your fault
everything's dry here now.

409
00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:05.500
So, now that it's night,
we can get going again...

410
00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.670
If we knew which way to go.

411
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.790
Well, it's more fun
to step forward
than it is to sit still.

412
00:19:11.791 --> 00:19:13.330
Let's go this way!

413
00:19:13.331 --> 00:19:14.330
(LOUD THUMP)

414
00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:16.670
Did anybody take a step?

415
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.080
Nope.
ONO: Negative.

416
00:19:18.081 --> 00:19:19.330
Not me.
MAKINI: No.

417
00:19:19.331 --> 00:19:20.540
(THUMPING CONTINUES)

418
00:19:20.541 --> 00:19:21.580
Someone's coming.

419
00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:28.830
Oh, no! You again!

420
00:19:28.831 --> 00:19:29.920
Wait!

421
00:19:29.921 --> 00:19:31.670
I'm sorry
I scared you before.

422
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.580
I'm Kion. And this
is the Lion Guard.

423
00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:36.250
We're just
passing through.

424
00:19:36.251 --> 00:19:38.210
Well, then,
apology accepted.

425
00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:41.380
Name's Tupp.
And let me apologize
for being rude.

426
00:19:41.381 --> 00:19:43.000
I'm not really
a morning person.

427
00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:45.670
I see you took my advice
about getting out of the sun.

428
00:19:45.671 --> 00:19:47.670
Smart. You look
much more comfortable.

429
00:19:47.671 --> 00:19:49.330
But you also look thirsty.

430
00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:52.250
Follow me, my friends!

431
00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:55.040
(THUMPING CONTINUES)

432
00:19:58.210 --> 00:19:59.380
TUPP: I don't drink
much water myself,

433
00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:02.710
but travelers coming
through here are always
looking for water. Here.

434
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:06.880
Uh, that's not water,
little guy.

435
00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.710
Well, no, it's a plant.

436
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.710
But its leaves
can collect water.
See?

437
00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:17.880
Plenty for everyone.

438
00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:26.380
Here, Kion.

439
00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:28.920
(CHOMPING)
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

440
00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:31.420
(EXHALES DEEPLY)
Thanks, Makini.

441
00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:33.500
I didn't see
this plant before.

442
00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:35.670
It must have been
covered with sand.

443
00:20:35.671 --> 00:20:36.750
How did you know it was here?

444
00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.330
Well it's a plant.
It doesn't exactly move.

445
00:20:39.331 --> 00:20:41.080
But how did you find it?

446
00:20:41.081 --> 00:20:43.040
There aren't any
landmarks in this desert.

447
00:20:43.041 --> 00:20:44.250
And the dunes keep moving.

448
00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:45.580
Here in the desert,

449
00:20:45.581 --> 00:20:47.420
we don't look down
at the ground to find our way.

450
00:20:47.421 --> 00:20:48.540
We look up!

451
00:20:48.541 --> 00:20:50.080
At the sky!

452
00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:52.080
(ALL EXCLAIM)

453
00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.380
It's so pretty!

454
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:58.120
It looks like
a field of flowers.

455
00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:00.250
Oh, that's it!

456
00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:02.250
That's the field of flowers!

457
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:04.080
Of course!

458
00:21:04.081 --> 00:21:06.380
They're not flowers
on Rafiki's map.

459
00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:07.880
They're stars!

460
00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:12.000
Look! Four bright stars
in the shape of a diamond!

461
00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:13.580
Ah, yes.

462
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:16.960
Those stars are always
in the same place in the sky,

463
00:21:16.961 --> 00:21:18.380
spinning around in a circle.

464
00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.620
Do you know where they lead?

465
00:21:20.621 --> 00:21:22.120
(LAUGHS) Of course!

466
00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:24.120
They always lead there.

467
00:21:24.121 --> 00:21:26.120
Across the desert
to the tall cliffs.

468
00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:27.580
BOTH: The cliffs?

469
00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.080
Anga?

470
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.290
Got it. The
<i>moja kwa moja</i> stone
is on top of the cliffs!

471
00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:41.500
You were right
all along, Makini.

472
00:21:41.501 --> 00:21:42.830
Sorry we didn't believe you.

473
00:21:42.831 --> 00:21:44.120
It's okay, Kion.

474
00:21:44.121 --> 00:21:45.170
Thanks, Tupp.

475
00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:46.960
We can find our way
from here.

476
00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:52.460
MAKINI: Oh, oh!
And I know an amazing detour

477
00:21:52.461 --> 00:21:54.040
on our way back
to the Pride Lands.

478
00:21:54.041 --> 00:21:57.170
We can go see my mom
and dad, and tell them
all about our trip.

479
00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:59.170
BESHTE:
That sounds <i> poa.</i>
