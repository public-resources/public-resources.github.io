(STRAINING)

5
00:01:08.711 --> 00:01:10.120
Did you try pulling?

6
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.290
Of course I tried pulling!

7
00:01:12.291 --> 00:01:13.330
ONO: Everyone?

8
00:01:13.331 --> 00:01:15.960
We've got an impatient
antelope herd back here.

9
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.380
Seems they won't go anywhere
without Bupu.

10
00:01:18.381 --> 00:01:21.210
Of course not.
I am their leader.

11
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.500
Good thing he didn't lead
the whole herd into that tree.

12
00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:27.120
Wait. Instead of pulling
Bupu out of the tree,

13
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.620
why don't we just break off
the branch that's stuck?

14
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.210
So I'll be walking around with
a branch stuck to my horns?

15
00:01:33.211 --> 00:01:34.920
At least you'll be
walking around.

16
00:01:34.921 --> 00:01:37.330
Yeah. So you can
lead your herd.

17
00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:38.830
Like you're supposed to.

18
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.420
Not to mention,
it'll look great.

19
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.210
Maybe I'll start wearing
a branch.

20
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.790
Why don't you just see if you
can break off a piece, Bunga.

21
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.210
You got it, Kion.

22
00:01:48.211 --> 00:01:49.460

00:01:50.831 --> 00:01:51.960
(GRUMBLES)
Careful!

25
00:01:51.961 --> 00:01:53.750
NYUNI: <i>Quit shaking my branch!</i>

26
00:01:53.751 --> 00:01:55.420
(GASPS) A talking tree?

27
00:01:55.421 --> 00:01:57.500
Can't a bird feather his nest
in peace?

28
00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.500
Oh. Just a Bird.

29
00:01:59.501 --> 00:02:01.540
Hey, Nyuni!
You live here now?

30
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.120
Yes. I like to try staying

31
00:02:04.121 --> 00:02:05.460
in different parts
of the Savannah.

32
00:02:05.461 --> 00:02:08.250
And this was
a great place to live.

33
00:02:08.251 --> 00:02:11.750
Until someone waving around
his giant horns.

34
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.250
Bupu, I think he means you.

35
00:02:14.251 --> 00:02:15.580
(GRUMBLES)

36
00:02:15.581 --> 00:02:18.960
Nyuni, would you mind if you
had to find a new nest?

37
00:02:18.961 --> 00:02:21.000
Why should I have to move
just because

38
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:22.460
this big ox came along and...

39
00:02:22.461 --> 00:02:23.790
I am not an ox!

40
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.250
Or maybe he's not
talking about you!

41
00:02:26.251 --> 00:02:28.290
Oh, I'm talking about him
all right.

42
00:02:28.291 --> 00:02:30.670
ZAZU: What is all this
commotion about?

43
00:02:30.671 --> 00:02:32.250
Oh, hey, Zazu.

44
00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:33.250
Kion.

45
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.420
Hmm. An antelope
stuck in a tree...

46
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.790
This will most definitely be
included in my Morning Report.

47
00:02:40.791 --> 00:02:41.920
To the King?

48
00:02:41.921 --> 00:02:43.920
Does he need to find out
about this?

49
00:02:43.921 --> 00:02:45.250
Does everyone?

50
00:02:45.251 --> 00:02:48.330
It is my sworn duty to keep
the King informed

51
00:02:48.331 --> 00:02:50.580
of all the goings-on
in the Pride Lands.

52
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.420
No matter how bizarre
they may be.

53
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.670
Wait.

54
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.580
I think I know how you can
both be happy.

55
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.080
I don't know about this.

56
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.290
At least now you can lead
your herd again.

57
00:03:07.291 --> 00:03:10.460
And you get to see even more
of the Pride Lands this way.

58
00:03:10.461 --> 00:03:12.960
Yeah! Let's go Bupu!

59
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.880
(GROANS)
Let's go, antelopes.

60
00:03:15.881 --> 00:03:17.830
Whoa! Easy!

61
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.620
Hmm. Very original solution,
Kion.

62
00:03:21.621 --> 00:03:22.710
Thanks, Zazu.

63
00:03:22.711 --> 00:03:24.670
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I must see what else

64
00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:26.830
is transpiring
in the Pride Lands.

65
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.920
Not that I imagine anything
will top this.

66
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.210
Bupu, in the future, do try to
avoid running into trees.

67
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.290
Thank you, Zazu.

68
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.670
Zazu sure likes getting into
everybody's business.

69
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.380
It's his job, Fuli.

70
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.420
He looks out for all the
animals in the Pride Lands.

71
00:03:47.421 --> 00:03:48.540
Even us.

72
00:03:48.541 --> 00:03:50.580
Remember that time
he was after you

73
00:03:50.581 --> 00:03:51.960
to slow down
when we were little?

74
00:03:51.961 --> 00:03:53.330
Huh. Which time?

75
00:03:53.331 --> 00:03:56.290
The time Bunga and I
ran into the crocodiles...

76
00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.500
<i>Zuka Zama!</i>

77
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.290
There you are!

78
00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.250
Kion, didn't your father
tell you to stay put?

79
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.710
Aw, Zazu!

80
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.790
Me and Bunga
are on an adventure!

81
00:04:11.791 --> 00:04:13.540
BABY FULI: Coming through!

(EXCLAIMING)
(BOTH LAUGHING)

83
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.420
Now see here, young cheetah.
You need to slow down!

84
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.170
Slow down. Got it.
<i>Huwezi!</i>

85
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.500
That's not slowing down.

86
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.880
ZAZU: Fuli! Fuli!

87
00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.040
(BOTH LAUGHING)

88
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.210
And as for you two...

89
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.170
Kion? Bunga!

90
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.500
Oh, dear!
Where have you gotten to?

91
00:04:38.501 --> 00:04:40.080
Adventure, here we come!

92
00:04:40.081 --> 00:04:41.420
Yeah!

93
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.960
(GASPS) Crocodiles!

94
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.540
Crocodiles? Big deal.

95
00:04:46.541 --> 00:04:49.960
They can't stop us.
<i>Zuka Zama!</i>

96
00:04:49.961 --> 00:04:51.670
Bunga? Wait for me.

97
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.330
All right, croc-iddy crocs!
Outta the way!

98
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.580
What's this?

99
00:04:57.581 --> 00:04:59.170
Looks like a snack.

100
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.710
Careful crocodiles.

101
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.580
You don't want to
mess with us.

102
00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:05.920
Who do these little ones
think they are?

103
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.540
I'm Bunga!

104
00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:08.540
He's Kion!

105
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.420
And you crocs are
in our way!

106
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.580
(LAUGHING)

107
00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:16.500
Little cubs.

108
00:05:16.501 --> 00:05:19.580
This is crocodile territory.

109
00:05:19.581 --> 00:05:22.750
You should leave. Now!

110
00:05:22.751 --> 00:05:25.420
Unless you mean
to challenge me.

111
00:05:25.421 --> 00:05:27.670
Oh, yeah! That's right!

112
00:05:27.671 --> 00:05:30.290
You bet your bumps
I'm gonna challenge you!

113
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.460
What does "challenge" mean?

114
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.580
Hey! If you're messin' with
Bunga, you're messin' with me!

115
00:05:38.581 --> 00:05:40.040
Oh, good.

116
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.500
Two tasty snacks
at the same time...

117
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.120
(GULPS)

118
00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:46.380
Yummy!

119
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:48.040
ZAZU: Enough!

120
00:05:48.041 --> 00:05:49.120
BOTH: Zazu?

121
00:05:49.121 --> 00:05:51.330
I expect it's merely
an oversight

122
00:05:51.331 --> 00:05:52.460
on your part, Pua.

123
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.540
But surely you did not intend
for Makuu to eat...

124
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.920
The son of the King?

125
00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.960
This is the son of the King?

126
00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:04.250
Him. Not me.

127
00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.540
I hardly think the King
would be pleased

128
00:06:06.541 --> 00:06:09.250
if your crocs gobbled him up
for no reason.

129
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.380
"No reason?"

130
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.080
These two came to our watering
hole and challenged us.

131
00:06:15.081 --> 00:06:18.000
We have every right
to eat them.

132
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.540
Makuu is right, Zazu.

133
00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:23.460
King Simba knows
and respects our ways.

134
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.750
Zazu?

135
00:06:25.751 --> 00:06:27.500
Very well, Pua.

136
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.120
I, too, respect the
crocodile ways.

137
00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.460
But, as Kion's well-being
is my responsibility...

138
00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.040
I offer myself in his place.

139
00:06:38.041 --> 00:06:39.210
Huh?

140
00:06:39.211 --> 00:06:40.750
Un-Bunga-lievable!

141
00:06:40.751 --> 00:06:43.920
Though I am but a humble
adviser to King Simba,

142
00:06:43.921 --> 00:06:46.880
I expect I will satisfy
even the most

143
00:06:46.881 --> 00:06:49.460
discriminating of palates.

144
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.460
Simba is a good and fair King.

145
00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.830
I would not want to anger him
by eating his son.

146
00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.710
Or his royal adviser.

147
00:06:58.711 --> 00:07:03.000
Especially one who displays
the bravery of a crocodile.

148
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:04.460
(SIGHS)

149
00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.670
You three are
all free to go.

150
00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.920
Fine.
I wasn't that hungry anyway.

151
00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:14.170
Kion.

152
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.710
You and your friends should
not come here uninvited again.

153
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.710
Uh... Yes, sir!

154
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.710
Come you two. Quickly.

155
00:07:21.711 --> 00:07:24.750
Back to Pride Rock before Pua
changes his mind.

156
00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.330
Huh. I forgot all about that.

157
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:30.620
Zazu jumped into Makuu's mouth
to save you?

158
00:07:30.621 --> 00:07:31.830
That's brave.

159
00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.960
(SCOFFS)
He had to rescue you.

160
00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:36.210
You're the King's son.

161
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.120
Fuli,
he was in Makuu's mouth.

162
00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.620
Not everyone
can be that brave.

163
00:07:41.621 --> 00:07:45.120
I'll say. And I know all about
being brave.

164
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:46.960
Sure sounds like
bravery to me.

165
00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:48.460
Maybe.

166
00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.580
Keep an eye out for Zazu.

167
00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.040
Who-zu?

168
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:55.620
The bird. Right there.

169

170
00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.000
All appears to be
in order here.

171
00:08:00.001 --> 00:08:03.170
Pathway clear,
shrubs not too pointy.

172
00:08:03.171 --> 00:08:05.460
That's the bird
Scar wants us to grab?

173
00:08:05.461 --> 00:08:06.460
Yeah.

174
00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.290
But why did he want us
to grab him?

175
00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:09.670
Who cares?

176
00:08:09.671 --> 00:08:12.380
When Scar tells me to
do something, I do it.

177
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:15.880
Just like when
I tell you to
do something,

178
00:08:15.881 --> 00:08:17.210
you do it.

179
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:21.250
(SIGHS)
Just grab the bird!

00:08:21.251 --> 00:08:22.290

181
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:24.120
(SQUAWKS)

182
00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.170
What is the meaning of this?

183
00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.790
Hyenas. I should have known.

184
00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:33.620
What do you think you're doing
in the Pride Lands?

185
00:08:33.621 --> 00:08:35.790
Actually, we're leaving
the Pride Lands.

186
00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.120
And you're coming with us.

187
00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:41.620
What? I most certainly am not!

188
00:08:41.621 --> 00:08:43.170
Grab him and let's get moving.

189
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:45.880
Unmouth me, you brute!

190
00:08:45.881 --> 00:08:48.670
Do you have any idea who I am?

191
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.620
Ooh, ooh! I know! I know!
You're Zazu.

192
00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:55.580
Yeah, and now that we've
all been properly introducted,

193
00:08:55.581 --> 00:08:56.750
let's go.

194
00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.330
You'll pay for this.

195
00:08:59.331 --> 00:09:01.790
I am adviser to the King.

196
00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:04.670
This is definitely making
my Morning Report.

197
00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:07.880
Zazu missed
the Morning Report?

198
00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.670
Zazu?

199
00:09:09.671 --> 00:09:11.330
That doesn't sound like him.

200
00:09:11.331 --> 00:09:12.670
It's never happened before.

201
00:09:12.671 --> 00:09:14.710
We just saw him
a little while ago.

202
00:09:14.711 --> 00:09:16.120
Maybe he's just late?

203
00:09:16.121 --> 00:09:18.210
No. It's not like him
to be late.

204
00:09:18.211 --> 00:09:19.210
For anything.

205
00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.120
Especially
the Morning Report.

206
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:23.170
If he's not here,
then I'm afraid

207
00:09:23.171 --> 00:09:24.460
something could be wrong.

208
00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:25.880
Don't worry, Dad.

209
00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.170
We'll find him and
make sure he's okay.

210
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.170
And I know just where
to start.

211
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:33.790
No.
I haven't seen
that busybody bird

212
00:09:33.791 --> 00:09:34.920
since this morning.

213
00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.790
Perhaps, he's out
embarrassing some other animal

214
00:09:37.791 --> 00:09:39.960
who found himself in
an unfortunate situation.

215
00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:41.380
How about you, Nyuni?

216
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:42.750
Seen anything from up there?

217
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:45.040
Nope,
but I'll keep an eye out.

218
00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:46.830
Hey, Bupu.

219
00:09:46.831 --> 00:09:48.750
Looks like one of the
little ones is wandering off.

220
00:09:48.751 --> 00:09:49.750
Again?

221
00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.210
Good catch, Nyuni.

222
00:09:51.211 --> 00:09:52.210
I'll take care of it.

223
00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:54.580
The two of them are
getting along now?

224
00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.540
Of course we're getting along.

225
00:09:56.541 --> 00:09:58.380
I'm very easy
to get along with.

226
00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:00.620
Ah, right. Of course.

227
00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:02.920
Ono, scan the skies.

228
00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.960
Fuli, see if you can track him
by scent.

229
00:10:05.961 --> 00:10:08.000
Affirmative.
On it, Kion.

230
00:10:08.001 --> 00:10:09.420
(SNIFFING)

231
00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.080
And I'll make sure
he knows we're looking
for him.

232
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.960
Zazu! We're looking for you!

233
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:19.000
If Zazu doesn't hear that,
we'll know he's in trouble.

234
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:22.500
(LAUGHING MANIACALLY)

235
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.170
I fail to see
what's so funny?

236
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:27.460
(LAUGHING)

237
00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:28.830
Really?

238
00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:32.500
It's funny
'cause you can't fly

239
00:10:32.501 --> 00:10:34.290
while you're trapped in there.

240
00:10:34.291 --> 00:10:36.920
(LAUGHS)
Get it?

241
00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.830
Maybe he had to be there.

242
00:10:40.831 --> 00:10:42.880
But he is here.

243
00:10:42.881 --> 00:10:45.830
Yeah.
He ain't going nowhere.

244
00:10:45.831 --> 00:10:47.880
(BOTH LAUGHING)

245
00:10:47.881 --> 00:10:50.710
Yes. So, now
that you've trapped me

246
00:10:50.711 --> 00:10:52.290
so cleverly.

247
00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:56.540
What, pray tell, is the rest
of your ingenious plan?

248
00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.960
You ain't gonna believe this,
but...

249
00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:00.710
We don't know.

250
00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:04.250
Yeah, we sure don't.

251
00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:06.880
We're waiting for Janja
to come back and tell us.

252
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:08.580
(SIGHS)

253
00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.170
Of course, you are.

254
00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:12.670
Ugh.

255
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:17.250
This wrongful imprisonment
will not go unanswered.

256
00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.330
Maybe we should just eat him.

257
00:11:19.331 --> 00:11:20.330
You think?

258
00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:23.830
Oh, you're thinking now?

259
00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.540
So, what would Janja think
if he returned to find

260
00:11:27.541 --> 00:11:28.580
that you've eaten me?

261
00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:31.420
Oh, yeah.
He's right.

262
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:33.620
We gotta wait for Janja.

263
00:11:33.621 --> 00:11:34.620
Thanks, Zazu.

264
00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.880
Honestly your plan would
utterly fall apart

265
00:11:37.881 --> 00:11:38.920
if it were't for me.

266
00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.540
We got the bird, Scar.
So now what?

267
00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.000
Now, you get Zazu

268
00:11:44.001 --> 00:11:46.040
to tell you
everything he knows.

269
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:48.830
And you listen.

270
00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:50.830
We went to
all that trouble

271
00:11:50.831 --> 00:11:53.830
just to listen to that
annoying, little bird?

272
00:11:53.831 --> 00:11:55.620
That annoying, little bird

273
00:11:55.621 --> 00:11:58.080
is the King's royal adviser.

274
00:11:58.081 --> 00:11:59.880
He knows Simba's strengths,

275
00:11:59.881 --> 00:12:02.920
his weaknesses,
who his allies are.

276
00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.170
In short, Zazu is keeper

277
00:12:06.171 --> 00:12:09.380
of all the secrets of
the Pride Lands.

278
00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:12.040
Oh, and if he tells us,

279
00:12:12.041 --> 00:12:15.080
then we know all the secrets
of the Pride Lands.

280
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.250
And armed with that knowledge

281
00:12:17.251 --> 00:12:18.920
taking over the Pride Lands

282
00:12:18.921 --> 00:12:20.920
will be a simple matter.

283
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:23.250
Even for you.

284
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:26.250
Yeah, even for me.

285
00:12:26.251 --> 00:12:29.330
Hyenas would rule
the Pride Lands.

286
00:12:29.331 --> 00:12:30.580
Yes.

287
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.620
But there's no time to waste.

288
00:12:32.621 --> 00:12:35.500
Zazu is very important
to the royal family.

289
00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.710
No doubt,
Kion and his Lion Guard

290
00:12:38.711 --> 00:12:40.920
are already looking for him.

291
00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:43.500
Oh, I'll get him to talk,
all right.

292
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.330
It'll be easy.

293
00:12:45.331 --> 00:12:47.790
He hasn't shut that hornbill
of his since we found him.

294
00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:50.380
What have we here?

295
00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.790
(GASPS) Those look like
Zazu's feathers.

296
00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.290
Everyone! Everyone!
Over here.

297
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.380
(SNIFFS)
That's Zazu, all right.

298
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:03.960
There's more over here.

299
00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:07.790
What do you think happened?

300
00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:10.000
Nothing good,
that's for sure.

301
00:13:10.001 --> 00:13:11.960
I don't know.
Zazu's pretty old.

302
00:13:11.961 --> 00:13:13.540
Maybe his feathers
just fell out.

303
00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.250
I don't think so, Bunga.

304
00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:16.750
KION: Definitely not.

305
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:21.000
And I bet it has something
to do with these hyena tracks.

306
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.290
The hyenas
must have taken Zazu.

307
00:13:24.291 --> 00:13:25.500
The hyenas?

308
00:13:25.501 --> 00:13:27.500
What do they want with that
poor, old bird?

309
00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.290
I'm not waiting to find out.

310
00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:30.790
Follow me.

311
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:37.500
So...
Why should
I let you go?

312
00:13:37.501 --> 00:13:40.920
Because,
it's the smart thing to do.

313
00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:43.710
And you're the smart one.

314
00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:45.330
Huh?

315
00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.250
Chungu,
I'll address this to you

316
00:13:48.251 --> 00:13:51.580
since obviously,
you are the smart one.

317
00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:53.250
That's what I always thought.

318
00:13:53.251 --> 00:13:55.580
I just didn't think of it
till now.

319
00:13:55.581 --> 00:13:57.880
When you said it. (GIGGLES)

320
00:13:57.881 --> 00:13:59.080
Hear that, Cheezi?

321
00:13:59.081 --> 00:14:02.830
The smart bird says
I'm the smart one.

322
00:14:02.831 --> 00:14:05.880
(LAUGHS)
Yeah! That makes sense.

323
00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:09.250
But isn't Janja
the smart one?

324
00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:13.420
Actually, I believe
that you both
are the smart ones.

325
00:14:13.421 --> 00:14:14.920
Yeah, right!

326
00:14:14.921 --> 00:14:17.290
(GIGGLES)
We is the smart ones!

327
00:14:17.291 --> 00:14:20.210
Indeed!
And the smart thing to do

328
00:14:20.211 --> 00:14:24.000
is to let me go
and tell Janja I escaped.

329
00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:27.330
Ooh, that is smart!

330
00:14:27.331 --> 00:14:29.120
Yeah!

331
00:14:29.121 --> 00:14:33.330
If we're smart, we gotta do
what the smart bird says!

332
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:35.960
JANJA: Oh, no, you don't!
Oh, dear.

333
00:14:35.961 --> 00:14:37.920
Nice try, bird-brain.

334
00:14:37.921 --> 00:14:40.420
"Bird brain" (LAUGHING)

335
00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.880
Is that like a fur-brain?

336
00:14:42.881 --> 00:14:44.170
See what
I have to deal with?

337
00:14:44.171 --> 00:14:45.920
I'm beginning to.

338
00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:49.790
Now. You're gonna tell us
everything you know, bird.

339
00:14:49.791 --> 00:14:53.960
So start spilling some
royal secrets. And fast.

340
00:14:53.961 --> 00:14:58.170
Please. The three of you
don't scare me.

341
00:14:58.171 --> 00:14:59.170
(CHUCKLES)

342
00:14:59.171 --> 00:15:01.250
(HYENAS SNARLING)

343
00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:10.380
Oh...
That is a lot of hyenas.

344
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.620
Fine. Here is what
I have to say.

345
00:15:14.621 --> 00:15:18.790
(SHOUTING)
If anyone can hear me,
I'm trapped in the Outlands!

346
00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.000
We already know that.

347
00:15:21.001 --> 00:15:23.920
Yeah. We're right here.
You don't have to shout.

348
00:15:23.921 --> 00:15:25.080
Ugh!

349
00:15:25.081 --> 00:15:26.420
We ain't got time for this!

350
00:15:26.421 --> 00:15:30.000
Oh, I'm sorry,
were you in a hurry?
I'll make this quick.

351
00:15:30.001 --> 00:15:33.120
(SHOUTING)
I'm near the Hyeya's volcano!

352
00:15:33.121 --> 00:15:34.380
Enough screaming!

353
00:15:34.381 --> 00:15:38.120
Unless you'd like me
to give you something
to scream about.

354
00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:43.330
Specially seeing as how
you're startin' to get me
a little steamed.

355
00:15:43.331 --> 00:15:44.750

seen Zazu in action!

that you saved me
from the crocs

my inspection of the path
through the grasslands,
