doing here, hawk?

The Pride Lands aren't
your hunting grounds.

are filled with delicacies

can't hunt here.

That's right.

70

The reason there are
so many different animals
in the Pride Lands

71
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.460
is because we all respect
the Circle of Life.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.420

103
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.500
Hmm... Judging by the speckles
and the size,

104
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.380
I'd say it belongs
to a hammerkop.

105
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.420
But why would a hammerkop
leave its egg in your nest?

106

I don't know.

107
00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:13.749
Hammerkops are usually
excellent parents.

108
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.380
Then there has to be
a good reason.

109
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.540
We need to find
the mother hammerkop

110
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.460

everything is okay.

113
00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:27.499
You think the egg will be okay
up there by itself?

114
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.330

Huh, not a lot
of hollow space...

116
00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.829
The baby's
getting big inside.

117
00:05:36.829 --> 00:05:38.619
Does that mean
it's close to hatching?

118
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.580
Yes. It will need someone
to sit on it to keep it warm

until the baby bird's
ready to be born.
