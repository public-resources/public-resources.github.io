Almost there! Anga said
the next moja kwa moja stone
is just over this hill.

Kion, wait.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.710
Do you hear that?
(WAVES SPLASHING)

7
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.500
That you, Big B?

8
00:01:18.501 --> 00:01:19.920
I don't think so.

9
00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:21.580
Sounds like growling leopards!

10
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.250
Whatever it is,
it's coming from
over the hill.

11
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.540
Anga! What's making
that sound?

12
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.540
It's a, uh...

13
00:01:28.541 --> 00:01:30.420
Come on! You'll see.

14
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.380
Poa!

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:36.620
See.

FULI: Yeah.
That's the most water
I've ever seen.

17
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.250
That's the loudest water
I've ever heard.

18
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.040
All I can see is
a whole lot of blue.

19
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.460
But it sounds like
we're looking at an ocean.

20
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.580
Oh! The ocean!

21
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.540
I saw this
the last time I went to
the Tree of Life.

Anga, please tell me

23
00:01:55.331 --> 00:01:58.250
the next moja kwa moja stone
isn't in the middle
of the ocean.

24
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.080
Nope. It's out there.

25
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.960
On top of that hill.

26
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.960
Great. It's not that far.

27
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.380

Hang on. I'll get you
back to shore. (CLICKING)

39
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.210
Those clicks
sound like a dolphin.
Actually, not a fish.

But I've never been
to the ocean before.
What's it like in there?

52

Oh, it's beautiful.

53
00:03:15.211 --> 00:03:16.830
Ever wish you had feet?

No, but...
'Cause if you were,

110
00:06:06.711 --> 00:06:11.880
you'd know,
on that spit o' land,
there be dragons!

see any dragons?

Don't know
what they look like.

116
00:06:24.121 --> 00:06:27.040
They don't look like anything,
because they're not real.

Whoa!

357
00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.330
I got him, Little B.

358
00:16:53.331 --> 00:16:54.830
That's what you think.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

360
00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.330
You should be safe here.

361
00:16:58.331 --> 00:16:59.460
Thanks, Anga.

362
00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:02.250
Ono! Grab some seaweed
and follow me.

363
00:17:02.251 --> 00:17:03.460
Affirmative.

Huh?
(GRUNTS)

369
00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.460
Hey! Don't talk with
your mouth full...

370
00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:25.330

374
00:17:36.171 --> 00:17:37.540

Did I get him?
Did I get him?

Yup.

377
00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:43.380
Twende kiboko!

378

Kion! Look what we found!

379
00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.750
Mmm. Thanks Makini.

380
00:17:52.751 --> 00:17:54.500
Feel better?
Definitely.

381
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:56.670
Did you find
the mojo kwa moja stone, too?

382
00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:01.620
Yes. But Anga says we need to
get off this island to get
to the next landmark.

383
00:18:01.621 --> 00:18:03.250
Then that's what we'll do.

384
00:18:03.251 --> 00:18:05.710
Kion? How are we gonna
do that?

385
00:18:05.711 --> 00:18:06.920
Leave that to me.

Anga, am I seeing
what I think I'm seeing?

00:19:12.001 --> 00:19:13.000
Yup.

Come on.

Anga? Ono? You know where
to go from here?
