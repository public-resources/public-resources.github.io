can make them move...

And the zebra stampede
and rock fall

were just like the painting.

Seriously?
Yeah.

322
00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:12.210
And then we saw Kion
fall off the tree branch.

hard to believe.

Save him? Save him from what?

349
00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:27.580
Remember how Bunga knew
to steer the zebras
away from the rocks?

350
00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:30.580
Yeah?
Well there's a reason
he knew.

351
00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:43.210
If you're right,
I better help.

352
00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:44.420
Kion's in danger.

353
00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:46.710
Not anymore, Ono.
Now that you know,

354
00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:49.380
Kion has the whole Lion Guard
looking out for him.

355
00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:53.250
Yeah. And we'll make sure
he doesn't get anywhere
near a tree.

356
00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:56.710
KION: Lion Guard.
I found the zebras.
(ALL GASP)

357
00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:59.380
We can cross the river
on this big tree branch.

358
00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:01.539
Don't worry, I'll save him.

359
00:18:01.539 --> 00:18:03.579
Me too!
Let's all save him.

360
00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:05.880
Kion. No.

361
00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.710
Ono?
Sorry. Didn't mean
to startle you.

362
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:11.620
But Fuli, Bunga and Beshte...
Oh, no!

363
00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:12.749
Look out.
Me first.

364
00:18:12.749 --> 00:18:14.669
BESHTE: Wait for me.
Whoa!

We were just
trying to save you.

371
00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.380
Save me? From what?

372
00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:33.580
The tree branch.

373
00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:35.330
The tree branch?

374
00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:38.290
Rafiki's painting showed
you falling from
a big tree branch.

375
00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:42.330
Bunga. There's no way Rafiki's
paintings tell the future.

376
00:18:42.331 --> 00:18:46.161
Now let's focus on
getting these zebras
back to their herd.

Could you get up? Please?

378
00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:51.329
Oh, sorry.

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:55.330
Oh, no!

380
00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:57.580

<i>Heyvi kabisa.</i>

387
00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.210
I have an idea. Come on.

388
00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:27.370
I've got to roar
from that branch
over the waterfall.

389
00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:29.210
But, Kion, the painting!

390
00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:32.620
I don't care.
It's the only way
to save the zebras.

391
00:19:35.329 --> 00:19:38.619
After I roar, make sure
the zebras are okay.

392
00:19:38.619 --> 00:19:40.289
You got it, Kion!

Kion! No!

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:23.790
I'm okay!

00:20:25.789 --> 00:20:27.119
I wasn't worried.

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:32.330
RAFIKI:
These paintings?
Tell the future?

407
00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:36.500
(LAUGHS) Bunga!
Why would you think
such a thing?

408
00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:40.580
'Cause, 'cause we saw
the zebras run and the rocks
fall and then we...

409
00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:44.420
(LAUGHS) First,
do not take Rafiki's staff.

410
00:20:44.461 --> 00:20:49.711
Second, these paintings?
You did not see
what you think you saw.

411
00:20:49.711 --> 00:20:51.499
You watched them backwards.

412
00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:55.380
The rocks fall
and the zebras run!

413
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:58.920
And all of this happened
in the past!

414
00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:00.460
BOTH: The past?

415
00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:03.539
Yes, yes. These paintings,

416
00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:06.580
they show the history
of the Pride Lands.

417
00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:09.500
What about this one?
It shows Kion falling!

418
00:21:09.541 --> 00:21:13.421
(LAUGHS) Leap to conclusions
and you leap to confusions!

419
00:21:13.421 --> 00:21:15.579
We leap to what? I'm confused.

420
00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:19.040
That is not Kion.
It's Nala's father,

421
00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.830
Kion's grandfather,
when he was a cub.

422
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:25.210
And you did not watch
the whole thing.

423
00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:29.379
Kion's grandfather did fall
from a big branch.

424
00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:31.460
But he was saved

425
00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.620
by the Lion Guard of his day.

426
00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:37.380
You see? These paintings
do not predict your future.

427
00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.459
Except for this new one.

428
00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.790
Is that me?
What am I gonna do?
Something fun?

429
00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:49.420
Cleaning the floor?
That doesn't look like fun!

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.330

the other paintings better.
