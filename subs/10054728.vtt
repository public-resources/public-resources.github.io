00:00:58.209 --> 00:01:00.749
(NARRATOR READING)

(KION READING)

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:06.380
(GROWLS)

6
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.880
Back off!
You back off, Kion.

7
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.959
That's my tree!
Your tree?

8
00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:12.329
I found it first.

9
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.250
So step aside.

10
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.500
No way!

11
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.170
You can't tell me
what to do.

12
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.960
Uh, actually, she can.

13
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.250
For the next few days,
Kiara will be queen.

14
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.579
Me?
Her? Queen?

15
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.250
Dad, what's going on?

16
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.290
Kiara will be acting queen

17
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.880
while your Mom and I
are away in Kilio Valley.

18
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.330
Kilio Valley? You're
visiting the elephants?

19
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.379
Yes. We have
a funeral to attend.

20
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.170
My friend Aminifu
passed away.

21
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.670
I remember him.

22
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.380
He was a wise elephant.

23
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.250
Yes. He helped
the Pride Lands
return to normal

24
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.959
after Scar was defeated.

25
00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:48.619
Once the elephants returned,

26
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.420
all the other
animals followed.

27
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.040
And the Circle of Life
came back into balance.

28
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.330
And now Aminifu
has completed

29
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.000
his part
of the Circle of Life.

30
00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:59.879
I'm so sorry, Dad.

31
00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:02.959
Uh, how long
will you be gone?

32
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.040
Just a few days.

33
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.380
And I'll let you in
on a little secret.

34
00:02:07.421 --> 00:02:10.461
I was nervous about ruling
the Pride Lands
at first, too.

35
00:02:10.461 --> 00:02:12.499
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
I'm not nervous.

36
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.830
Well, maybe a little.

37
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.960
It's okay.
I have faith in you...

38
00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.999
and the Lion Guard.

39
00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:25.829
Just keep the peace,
and everything
will be fine.

40
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.290
I won't let you down, Dad.

41
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.380
I know, princess.

42
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.330
Or, should I say Queen?

43
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.670
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

44
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.920
It is a big responsibility.

45
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.750
Worried about Kiara?

46
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.499
Or are you worried
about your tribute?

47
00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:50.169
Why would I be
worried about that?

48
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.790
Maybe because you have to
say it in Elephantese?

49
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.250
(SIGHS) Yes. Elephants
and their traditions.

50
00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.710
And they
take those traditions
very seriously, sire.

51
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.500
Oh, believe me, I know.
It has to be perfect.

52
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.960
True. But it's
just one phrase.

53
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.790
<i>Eihe kala pano tou.</i>

54
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.419
Hmm. Easy for you to say.

55
00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:13.329
Oh, I suppose it is.

56
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.330
But then, I am
fluent in Elephant.

57
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.420
Not to mention
gorilla, chimpanzee,

58
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.500
and several dialects
of bushbuck.

59
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.420
Yes, Zazu. We know.

60
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.379
ZAZU: Believe me, sire.

61
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.750
By the time we get there,
I'll have you speaking
like a true elephant!

62
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.880
Hmm. Simba and Nala
leaving the Pride Lands.

63
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.249
This will be worth
keeping an eye on.

64
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.920
SIMBA: It's things like this

65
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.420
that almost make me
wish I wasn't king.

66
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.380
Come now, sire.

67
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.419
It's really
not as bad as all that.

68
00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:49.959
Having to say goodbye
to an old friend

69
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.290
in a language
that I don't understand?

70
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.500
Yes, this is
an unfortunate duty.

71
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.540
But you have so many other
wonderful ones, sire,

72
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.329
if I may say so.

73
00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.169
Actually, Zazu,
I think Simba

74
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.620
could use
a little reminding.

75
00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.290

Yes. Thank you, Zazu.

I do feel better now.

118
00:06:10.459 --> 00:06:12.669
Wonderful, sire.

119
00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:15.539
Now, about your
Elephantese accent.

120
00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:16.380
(GULPS)

121
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.710
Hey! Did you hear? Kiara is
queen of the Pride Lands!

122
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.669
Yeah! It's
un-Bunga-lievable!

123
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:27.830
Hmm, it was going to
happen eventually.

124
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.790
I'm sure she'll be
a nice queen.

125
00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.620
Kiara's only queen while
my mom and dad are away.

126
00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:35.459
Anybody see Ono?

127
00:06:35.459 --> 00:06:37.999
It's not like him to be
late for morning patrol.

128
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.540
(GASPS) Here he comes.

129
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.210
And there he goes?

130
00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.580
What? Why is he
going to Pride Rock?

131
00:06:46.499 --> 00:06:48.499
ONO: Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

132
00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:49.669
Got to get clean
for the queen.

133
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:50.790
Ono.
(GASPS)

134
00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:52.000
What are you doing?

135
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.330
We've got a patrol.

136
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.040
Oh. I'm sorry, Kion.

137
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.540
Uh, Queen Kiara asked me...

138
00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:57.880
Queen Kiara?

139
00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.539
Uh, Kion?

140
00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:05.419
Announcing Her Majesty...
Ruler of the Pride Lands...

141
00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.250
BOTH: Queen Kiara!

142
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.620
Make way! Make way
for the queen!

143
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.329
Your Majesty.

144
00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:15.669
Bunga, that's really
not necessary.

145
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.750
Thank you, Your Majest...
You're queen now, Kiara.

146
00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:19.920
Let him bow.

147
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.880
Yeah. Everyone should bow.

148
00:07:23.249 --> 00:07:25.379
(CHUCKLING) Oh. Well,
not us.

149
00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.920
BUNGA: (MUFFLED)
It's my pleasure,
Your Majesty.

150
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.670
Bunga, stand up.

151
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.620
Your wish is my command!

152
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.660
Kiara, what was so important
you had to take Ono away
from our patrol?

153
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.170
Zazu went with
Mom and Dad, remember?

154
00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:42.500
I need someone to give me
the morning report.

155
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.790
And Ono is the
keenest of sight.

156
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:48.750
Yeah, okay.
But he's still
part of the Lion Guard.

157
00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:50.749
You should have
asked me first.

158
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.670
Kion! Kiara's your queen!

159
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:55.460
She doesn't have to ask
anyone for anything anymore.

160
00:07:57.459 --> 00:08:00.669
Except when I'm asking
for the morning report.

161
00:08:00.669 --> 00:08:03.209
Ono?
Your Majesty!

162
00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:04.960
(CLEARS THROAT) Uh,

163
00:08:05.001 --> 00:08:08.661
all appears to be in order
from Mekundu Cliffs
to Ukuni Woods.

164
00:08:08.661 --> 00:08:11.621
There's much excitement
about your becoming
acting queen.

165
00:08:11.621 --> 00:08:13.709
The oryxes aren't fighting,
for a change.

166
00:08:13.751 --> 00:08:17.711
The eland herd is migrating
east along the river
as expected.

167
00:08:17.711 --> 00:08:20.250
Oh, also on the path
along the river,

168
00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:22.540
I spotted a new cluster
of beehives.

169
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.789
Bees make great snacks.

170
00:08:24.789 --> 00:08:26.249
If you say so.

171
00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.380
And that's
the morning report.

172
00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.460
Interesting.
Thank you, Ono.

173
00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.290
Yeah. Great job, Ono.

174
00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:34.540
Thank you for the
opportunity, my queen.

175
00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:35.669
(GROANS)

176
00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:39.039
And you, er, my Kion?

177
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.250
Sounds like
everything is okay.

178
00:08:41.291 --> 00:08:45.251
So can I have Ono back for the
Guard's morning patrol now?

179
00:08:45.251 --> 00:08:47.460
Hang on, I'm...
I'm thinking.

180
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.790
The bees are building hives
on the path along the river.

181
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:51.790
The elands use
that same path.

182
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:54.620
If the elands step on the
beehives, they'll get stung!

183
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.580
The herd would break up
and there could be chaos.

184
00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:58.789
I didn't think of that.

185
00:08:58.789 --> 00:09:01.669
You didn't have to.
You're not the queen.

186
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:03.120
(LAUGHS)

187
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.460
Okay. Lion Guard,
let's move out.

188
00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:08.080
Kion, wait.

189
00:09:08.121 --> 00:09:11.461
Can you and the Guard
divert the eland away
from the bees' nests?

190
00:09:11.461 --> 00:09:14.499
Huh? I guess
we could, but...

191
00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.080
Ohh! Queen Kiara's
first official decree!

192
00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.790
My first decree?

193
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:21.250
Queen Kiara's first decree!

194
00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.790
The Lion Guard will...
What was it?

195
00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:27.750
The Lion Guard will divert
the eland herd away
from the beehives.

196
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.620
So says the queen.

197
00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.830
Yes. So says me.

198
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:32.710
(GROANS)

199
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:34.040
Come on, guys.

200
00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.619
By your command,
my queen.

201
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:40.750
Did I just get an order
from my sister?

202
00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:44.170
No. You got
an official decree.

203
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.920
No, no, no, sire.

204
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:51.669
Like this,
<i>Eihe kala pano tou.</i>

205
00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:55.250
Ehke kana pao tu.

206
00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:57.380
(GROANS) What's does
this mean, again?

207
00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:01.960
Literally, it translates to,
"He had good on him."

208
00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.040
It means he was
a good elephant.

209
00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.960
Well, that is
certainly true.

210
00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.500
Aminifu had
much good on him.

211
00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.620
And now, you'll just have
to say it in Elephantese.

212
00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:14.039
I can't say it
in Elephantese.

213
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.750
And do you know why?

214
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:17.880
Because I'm
not an elephant.

215
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:19.710
(ROARS)

216
00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.620
ZAZU: I'm okay.

217
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.709
Simba, you may not
be an elephant,

218
00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:26.880
but you are king.

219
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.880
And as king,
this is expected of you.

220
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.000
(SIGHS)

221
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.120
And Aminifu
was a good friend.

222
00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.500
He deserves the best.

223
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.879
Thanks, Nala.
Okay, Zazu.

224
00:10:36.879 --> 00:10:38.169
Once more, from the top.

225
00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:42.790
Of course, sire.

226
00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:44.880
(BUZZING)

227
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.000
KION: (GROANS) No.

228
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.289
Beehives in the path.

229
00:10:47.289 --> 00:10:49.039
Just like you said, Ono.

230
00:10:49.039 --> 00:10:50.459
Where are the elands?

231
00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:56.540
ONO:
They're on their way, Kion!

232
00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:58.670
Uh, just around the bend!

233
00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:00.539
Okay. When they get here,

234
00:11:00.539 --> 00:11:03.709
we'll move them off the path
and across the fields

235
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:05.330
far away from the bees.

236
00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.210
Hard to believe
something so small

237
00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:08.960
could bother
something so big.

238
00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.040
Yeah.

239
00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.829
Seems kind of silly.

240
00:11:11.829 --> 00:11:13.249
Moving a whole herd
of elands

241
00:11:13.249 --> 00:11:14.959
just to avoid
a few little bees?

242
00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.960
That was
Queen Kiara's decree.

243
00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:20.380
(GROANS) Yeah,
Queen Kiara's decree.

244
00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.790
She's only been
queen for a day.

245
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:24.459
I've been leading
the Lion Guard

246
00:11:24.459 --> 00:11:26.499
for a lot longer than that.

247
00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.750
Kiara can tell me
to do something.

248
00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:30.500
But she can't tell
me how to do it.

249
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.500
I say we move the bees.

250
00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:33.920
Move the bees?

251
00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.209
Move the bees?

252
00:11:35.209 --> 00:11:36.919
Yeah! Let's move the bees!

00:11:36.919 --> 00:11:38.379

Bees taste even
better when they're mad!

257

Maybe we should've diverted
the eland herd after all!

about the elands!

with the bees and the elands.

A small problem?

It wasn't a total disaster.

about the bees

and you were wrong.

272
00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.000
I admit it, Your Majesty!

273
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.540
What's to admit?
The queen is always right.

274
00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:34.380
Especially giving titles
to her top advisors.

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:43.960
Well, we did manage to

278
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.920
round up the elands...

279
00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.420
eventually.

280
00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:49.039
Most of them.

281
00:12:49.039 --> 00:12:51.169
Some of them didn't want
to come with us.

282
00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:53.040
I don't think
they liked us.

Maybe next time you'll
listen to your queen.

Next time?

00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:00.460
Yeah. Next time
I give you a decree.

But why didn't Janja
come himself?

Janja's not exactly welcome
in the Pride Lands.

on neutral ground.

trust Mzingo.

stand the thought
that I might be right.

It's Kiara, Grandfather.

354
00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:42.460
She doesn't know what she's
getting herself into.

355
00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:46.250
Kion. Kiara is your sister.

356
00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:48.880
And for now,
she is your queen.

357
00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:53.789
And as your queen and sister,
she needs your support.

358
00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:55.250
Even if she's wrong?

359
00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:58.080
Especially if she's wrong.

360
00:16:59.329 --> 00:17:01.329
Hmm. Thank you, Grandfather.

362
00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:07.250
I better go talk to her.

363
00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.170
She's already gone?

364
00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:13.709
(EXHALES) She said she had
some important meeting

365
00:17:13.709 --> 00:17:16.079
to go to... Somewhere.

366
00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.920
And you let her go alone?

367
00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:21.420
She's the queen.
We didn't let her
do anything.

368
00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:22.920
She just did it.

369
00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:26.459
Ugh! Some advisors
you two are!

370
00:17:26.459 --> 00:17:28.079
What's wrong with him?

371
00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.710
(SCOFFS) Who cares?
He's not a queen.

372
00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:35.120

Kiara's in trouble!

374

ALL: Lion Guard defend!

375
00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:47.420
And now,
His Majesty the King

376
00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:50.289
will say a few words
about my father.

377
00:17:50.289 --> 00:17:51.419
The king?

378
00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:52.920
Simba? (GASPS)

379
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:54.880
His Majesty.

(BREATHES DEEPLY)

383
00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:04.379
I knew Aminifu a long time.

384
00:18:04.421 --> 00:18:08.081
And now that he has
completed his journey
though the Circle of Life,

385
00:18:08.081 --> 00:18:10.620
I will remember him fondly.

Huh?
Huh?

392
00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.249
Did I say he had
good on him?

393
00:18:25.249 --> 00:18:28.499
I'm not sure, sire,
but I think you just said

394
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.380
he had poop on him.

396
00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.460

It's true. (LAUGHING)

400
00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:52.249
He always did have
poop on him.

401
00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:55.000
And it always
made us laugh.

402
00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:59.750
He always made us laugh.

403
00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:02.209
It's nice to remember
the good times.

404
00:19:02.209 --> 00:19:04.329
Thank you,
Your Highness.

405
00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:07.040
Well, he had good
on him, too.

406
00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:10.580
He did. He truly
had good on him.

407
00:19:11.419 --> 00:19:12.829
But more poop. (LAUGHING)

Queen Kiara. Welcome.

412
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.329
I'm so happy
you considered my proposal.

413
00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:30.460
And you came alone.
Very smart.

414
00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:33.380
We can work out our deal,
leader to leader.

415
00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:34.750
Just the two of us.

416
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.580
More or less.

417
00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:45.380

re-considered
your proposal.

Going so soon?
But you're to be our guest.

420
00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:54.460
Soon as Simba hears
I have his daughter,

421
00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:56.420
he'll have no choice

422
00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:00.330
but to turn over the
Pride Lands to me.

out here all on your own.

two were fighting, Janja.

wasn't anything
