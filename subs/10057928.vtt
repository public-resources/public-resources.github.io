Are you meeting

Nah. I'll just go hunt
by myself.

Not today.

111

You're eating with us,

112
00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.080
and I'm not taking no
for an answer.

113
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.620
But I...
Ah, ah, ah.

114
00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.499

If it is true,

120

we haven't been
very good friends to Fuli.

121
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.500
We need to be sure
Fuli knows we're
here for her.

122
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.830
How do we do that?

123
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.670
From now on, if any of us
sees Fuli all alone,

124
00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.580
we'll invite her to join us
in whatever we're doing.
