00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.540
It is the Roar of the Elders!

177
00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.250
When you use it,

178
00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:25.211
the great lions
of the Pride Lands' past
roar with you.

179
00:08:25.211 --> 00:08:28.579
What? You mean that's what
happened to my roar?

180
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.210
Yeah, lions in the sky!
I saw that!

181
00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:34.500
The Roar of the Elders
is a great gift, Kion.

182
00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:38.420
It will make you the fiercest
animal in the Pride Lands.

183
00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:40.500
But...
But what?

184
00:08:42.541 --> 00:08:48.791
No, no, Simba.
It is you who must tell Kion
about the Lion Guard.

185
00:08:48.791 --> 00:08:51.289
The Lion Guard?
What's that?

186
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.580
This way, Kion.

187
00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:57.620
Uh, okay...

188
00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.160
Oh, come on, Rafiki.
You already know what it is,
don'cha?

189
00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.040
Come on, tell me...

190
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:09.670
Huh?

191
00:09:13.289 --> 00:09:16.959
It's a bunch of vines?

192
00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:17.960
Rafiki?

193
00:09:23.209 --> 00:09:24.709
Whoa!

194
00:09:24.709 --> 00:09:27.169
Look at that!

195
00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:29.580
How did I not know
this was here?

196
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.250
Dad, what is this place?

197
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.460
This is Lion Guard Lair.

198
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.790
It's the secret meeting
place for the members
of the Lion Guard.

199
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:41.500
Ugh! Maybe they should think
about fixin' the place up.

200
00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.960
(COUGHS) Or at least
do some dusting...

201
00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.210
Hmmm... Yes...

202
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.420
(CHUCKLES)

203
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:03.420
Ah! That's more like it.

204
00:10:03.461 --> 00:10:06.501
Can you show that trick to my
Uncle Timon and Uncle Pumbaa?

205
00:10:06.501 --> 00:10:07.790
(CHUCKLES)

206
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:10.210
Dad, enough with all
the secrecy stuff!

207
00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:13.579
You gotta tell me.
What is the Lion Guard?

208
00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:17.000
The Lion Guard is the team
that protects the Pride Lands

209
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.250
and defends
the Circle of Life.

210
00:10:19.291 --> 00:10:22.751
According to tradition,
the Lion Guard is made
of the Pride Lands'

211
00:10:22.751 --> 00:10:28.580
fiercest, bravest,
fastest, strongest,
and keenest of sight.

212
00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.540
So what happened to them?

213
00:10:30.581 --> 00:10:34.121
It looks like
they haven't been in
here since... Forever!

214
00:10:34.121 --> 00:10:38.209
I'm afraid it's a story
without a happy ending.

215
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:44.960
Whoa!
Whoa!

216
00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.710
SIMBA: When your grandfather
Mufasa was about your age,

217
00:10:50.711 --> 00:10:54.501
his younger brother, Scar,
was leader of the Lion Guard.

218
00:10:54.501 --> 00:10:57.580
Scar also had
the gift of the Roar.

219
00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:00.790
The Roar made Scar
feel powerful.

220
00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:03.999
But that power
went to Scar's head.

221
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.290
He began to think that
he should be king,

222
00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:09.040
instead of his
older brother Mufasa.

223
00:11:09.081 --> 00:11:14.121
So Scar ordered the Lion Guard
to help him take down Mufasa.

224
00:11:14.121 --> 00:11:15.830
When the Guard refused,

225
00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:17.750
Scar was furious.

226
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:20.290
And then,
Scar used the Roar

227
00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:22.750
to destroy the Lion Guard.

228
00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.669
What Scar didn't realize

229
00:11:24.669 --> 00:11:26.999
was that by using
the Roar for evil,

230
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.580
he would lose the power
of the Roar completely.

231
00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.920
<i>Heyvi kabisa...</i>

232
00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.169
Yeah...

233
00:11:36.169 --> 00:11:39.619
The Roar is
a very powerful gift.

234
00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:42.120
It can be used
for great good.

235
00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:45.880
But it can also lead
to terrible evil.

236
00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.919
Well, I'd never
be like Scar. Ever!

237
00:11:48.919 --> 00:11:50.919
I'm glad
to hear that, son.

238
00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.670
Because starting today,

239
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:55.960
you are the leader
of the new Lion Guard.

240
00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.210
I'm the what?

241
00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:59.170
You heard Simba. Ha-ha!

242
00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:02.579
The leader of the
new Lion Guard!
It is you!

243
00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:05.330
Yes! It. Is. You!

244
00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.880
Dad?
It's true, Kion.

245
00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:11.790
Wow... Amazing!

246
00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:15.039
It is. And now,
as leader of the Guard,

247
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.620
I need you to assemble
the Pride Lands' bravest,

248
00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:22.330
fastest, strongest,
and keenest of sight.

249
00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.249
Okay, Dad. Got it!

250
00:12:25.749 --> 00:12:28.039
Don't worry.
I'm gonna make you proud!

251
00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:31.210
Yes, Bunga?

252
00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:35.290
This is un-bunga-lievable!

253
00:12:35.919 --> 00:12:37.999
You see, Simba?

254
00:12:38.041 --> 00:12:42.621
And now Kion will choose
the best lions in
the Pride for the Guard.

255
00:12:42.621 --> 00:12:44.000
I hope so, Rafiki.

256
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.750
I'm still not sure
he's ready...

257
00:12:49.539 --> 00:12:51.419
(BIRDS CAWING)

258
00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:59.580
Wow! Me!
Leader of the Lion Guard...

259
00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.039
Protectors of
the Pride Lands!

260
00:13:02.039 --> 00:13:03.789
It's kinda scary...

261
00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:04.920
Hey, Kion... Kion!
Huh?

262
00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.500
Ergh! Bunga!

263
00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.460
Ready to start assembling
the Lion Guard?

264
00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:12.419
Huh? Now? Yeah? Huh?

265
00:13:12.419 --> 00:13:14.039
Yes! Augh!

266
00:13:14.039 --> 00:13:15.539
Just stop splashing me!

267
00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:16.880
Splashing?

268
00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:21.210
Oh. (CHUCKLES)
Sorry, Kion.

269
00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:23.750
<i>Hakuna matata,</i> Bunga.
Now c'mon!

270
00:13:25.459 --> 00:13:28.209
Time to assemble
the Lion Guard!

271
00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.710
Lion Guard?

272
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:34.880
Hmm...

273
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:40.080
Dad said the Lion Guard needs
the Pride Lands' bravest,

274
00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.330
strongest, fastest,
and keenest of sight.

275
00:13:43.371 --> 00:13:47.041
So I think I'll go ask
the bravest animal
in the Pride Lands first.

276
00:13:47.041 --> 00:13:48.709
Kion, wait!

277
00:13:48.709 --> 00:13:51.249
Before you go asking
whoever you think is
the bravest,

278
00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:52.620
think about this...

279
00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:55.790
I might not be
the biggest honey badger.

280
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:58.080
But I know
what's in my heart.

281
00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.120
And I'm not afraid
of anything, or anyone!

282
00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.829
I know, Bunga.
That's why...

283
00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:05.120
I'll help the Lion Guard
fight hyenas.

284
00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.500
Or jackals!
Or crocodiles!
Or vultures!

285
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:10.540
Vultures?
Or great big rock slides
or wild fires or floods!

286
00:14:10.581 --> 00:14:12.619
I will stand with
the Lion Guard!
I'll never give up!

287
00:14:12.619 --> 00:14:14.959
I'll, I'll...

288
00:14:15.001 --> 00:14:17.791
Why don't you stop talking
so I can ask you to join
the Lion Guard?

289
00:14:17.791 --> 00:14:19.580
Say what...

290
00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:22.040
Come on, Bunga!
You're the bravest
animal I know!

291
00:14:22.081 --> 00:14:25.291
I want you to be
the first to join
the new Lion Guard.

292
00:14:25.291 --> 00:14:28.119
<i>Zuka Zama!</i>

293
00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.170
<i>Zuka Zama,</i> indeed.

294
00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:33.710
I wonder if Janja knows
about the Lion Guard...

295
00:14:34.959 --> 00:14:36.499
You couldn't have made
a better choice.

296
00:14:36.499 --> 00:14:39.079
We're gonna make
a great team!

297
00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.710
I can't wait to tell
Uncle Timon
and Uncle Pumbaa.

298
00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:43.120
(PANICKED SCREAM IN DISTANCE)

299
00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.120
Kion! Do you hear that?

300
00:14:46.419 --> 00:14:48.749
ZURI: (STRAINING)
...little help?

301
00:14:48.749 --> 00:14:50.669
Sounds like
Kiara's friend, Zuri...

302
00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:52.790
And she needs help.

303
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:54.000
Our help!

304
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.960
It's our first adventure!

305
00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:59.790
Lion Guard to the rescue!

306
00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:01.749
Lion Guard to the rescue?

307
00:15:01.749 --> 00:15:03.919
Hey! Bunga, wait up!

308
00:15:05.831 --> 00:15:08.831
Hold still, Zuri.
Timon and Pumbaa said
they know how to help.

309
00:15:08.831 --> 00:15:11.000
(WHINING)
Where am I gonna go, Tiifu?

310
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.789
I'm stuck...

311
00:15:12.789 --> 00:15:14.959
(SIGHS) You wouldn't
be stuck

312
00:15:15.001 --> 00:15:17.831
if you didn't keep
stopping to sharpen your
claws on every other tree.

313
00:15:17.831 --> 00:15:21.961
But Kiara, if I don't
keep them sharp,
they don't stay shiny!

314
00:15:21.961 --> 00:15:23.540
TIMON: Don't worry, ladies.

315
00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.879
Me and Pumbaa have
everything under control.

316
00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.710
Timon's right.

317
00:15:28.751 --> 00:15:32.831
We used to help Simba
get his claws
out of logs all the time.

318
00:15:32.831 --> 00:15:35.120
And you're sure about this?

319
00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.329
Sure, I'm sure.

320
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:40.420
If it weren't for us,
your dad would still be
stuck to a tree somewhere.

321
00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:42.750
Ready, Pumbaa?
Ready!

322
00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:44.620
Okay, on three.

323
00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:46.960
One... Two...

Hang on, Zuri!
I'll save you!

337
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:17.170
Okay, Bunga.

338
00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:19.540
You've done enough
saving for one day.

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.120
Whoa.

00:16:23.919 --> 00:16:25.709
What's going on?

342
00:16:25.709 --> 00:16:28.329
Oh! I broke a claw!

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:29.790
It hurts!

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:32.710
There, there, Zuri.
You're gonna be just fine.

345
00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:35.380
Oh, hey, Kiara.
How'd the gazelle
tracking go?

346
00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:37.539
(SIGHS) We never
got to the gazelles.

347
00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:39.879
Zuri got her claws
stuck in a tree.

(LAUGHS) And then she
fell face first into
a log full of bugs!

349
00:16:45.081 --> 00:16:46.250
Mmm, mmm, mmm!

350
00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:48.620
Bugs are so gross!

351
00:16:49.209 --> 00:16:50.379
Mmm...

352
00:16:50.379 --> 00:16:52.619
And so delicious!

353
00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:53.620
Ooh, look.

354
00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:57.080
Another one.
(SCREAMS)

355
00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.420
Get it, get it away!

356
00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:00.040
(CONTINUES SCREAMING)

357
00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.829
Ow, my paw!

358
00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:03.999
(SOBBING)

359
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.040
Hey, everyone. Everyone!
Listen to this!

360
00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.540
Simba just put Kion

361
00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:13.710
in charge of
the new Lion Guard!

362
00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:14.959
Lion Guard?

363
00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.250
What's a Lion Guard?

364
00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:17.960
Dad just told me
about it.

365
00:17:18.001 --> 00:17:20.661
The Lion Guard
is the team that protects
the Pride Lands

366
00:17:20.661 --> 00:17:22.880
and defends
the Circle of Life!

367
00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.829
And I'm it's new leader!

368
00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:26.749
I'm gonna be
on the Lion Guard, too!

369
00:17:26.749 --> 00:17:29.289
It's un-Bunga-lievable!

370
00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:31.250
(CHUCKLES)
You and Bunga?

371
00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:33.210
Protecting the Pride Lands?

372
00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:35.540
Does Dad know about this?

373
00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:38.879
"Dad" told me to assemble
the Pride Lands' best.

374
00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.000
And I'm the best.
Just ask me!

375
00:17:41.041 --> 00:17:44.421
Well, if you ask me,
it sounds like it
might be dangerous.

376
00:17:44.421 --> 00:17:46.580
It's worse
than that, Pumbaa.

377
00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:48.790
It sounds like work.

378
00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:51.119
Yeah! It's both!

379
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.880
Eek... Work!

380
00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.250
Gee, Bunga. I dunno...

381
00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:58.620
Uncle Pumbaa,
Uncle Timon, please?

382
00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:01.580
Work? Danger?
Definitely not.

383
00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:05.249
Have you forgotten
our problem-free philosophy?

384
00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:07.040
It means no worries...

385
00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:10.000
I know it's not
<i>Hakuna matata,

Timon, Pumbaa, please.

447
00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:34.250
I really do need Bunga
on the Lion Guard.

448
00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:36.670
He's the bravest
animal I know.

449

Bravest animal you know?

00:20:38.829 --> 00:20:40.669
He's brave, all right.

451
00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:42.670
Brave bordering on stupid.

452
00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:43.920
Thanks, Kiara!

453
00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.040
Well, when you
put it that way...

454
00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.040
Congratulations, Bunga!

455
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.169
We always knew
you had it in you!

456
00:20:50.169 --> 00:20:52.079
Oh, brother!

457
00:20:52.121 --> 00:20:55.621
Kion's gonna wreck
the Pride Lands before
I even get to be Queen.

458
00:20:55.621 --> 00:20:58.000
Oh, Bunga. I'm so proud,
I could...

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.750
(BREAKS WIND)

460
00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:00.749
Oops.

461
00:21:01.379 --> 00:21:03.039
Sorry.

462
00:21:03.039 --> 00:21:05.579
Zuri, let's get you
back to Pride Rock.

463
00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:07.000
We're outta here!

464
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.080
I better go assemble
the rest of my team...

465
00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:12.540
Wait, Kion! The Lion Guard
needs to stick together!

466
00:21:13.829 --> 00:21:15.829
Was it something
I said?

467
00:21:23.419 --> 00:21:26.499
Janja, I'm hungry!

468
00:21:26.499 --> 00:21:27.879
Me, too!

469
00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.210
You two only have
yourselves to blame.

470
00:21:30.251 --> 00:21:33.711
To think that you were scared
by the roar of a lion cub!

471
00:21:33.711 --> 00:21:36.710
Janja, see, Kion's roar,

472
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:40.329
it wasn't like,
like a normal roar.

473
00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:44.540
It was, uh...
(NERVOUS LAUGH) Super loud!

474
00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:49.120
And the clouds!
They turned into
roaring lions!

475
00:21:50.959 --> 00:21:53.039
Oh! So you're
scared of clouds, too?

476
00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.580
(LAUGHING)

477
00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:58.080
Stuff it, fur brains!

478
00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.500
Seems we have a visitor
to our humble humid den.

479
00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.919
Janja. Hyenas.

480
00:22:03.961 --> 00:22:07.921
Mzingo! What are you doing
this far into the Outlands?

481
00:22:07.921 --> 00:22:09.380
Looking for leftovers?

482
00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:11.750
No, but I'd be
happy to eat...

483
00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:13.919
Forget it.
We don't have any.

484
00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:17.250
Simba's cub, Kion,
managed to cancel
our lunch plans.

485
00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:18.830
(LAUGHING)

486
00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:21.580
Then you already
know about Kion.

487
00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:23.040
Know what?

488
00:22:23.081 --> 00:22:28.081
Simba has told Kion
to assemble
a new Lion Guard.

489
00:22:28.081 --> 00:22:30.790
Lion Guard?
That's impossible.

490
00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:33.580
The Lion Guard
died out after Scar...

491
00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:35.710
Unless...

492
00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:37.119
(STAMMERS) Janja?

493
00:22:37.119 --> 00:22:39.919
The Roar! Of course!

494
00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.250
Of course what?

495
00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:42.920
Don't you know the stories?

496
00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.080
The Lion Guard
was legendary.

497
00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:49.170
The most powerful team
of lions in the Pride Lands.

498
00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:51.749
At least they were...
(SNICKERING)

499
00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:54.710
Until Scar destroyed them!

500
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:57.210
(LAUGHING)

501
00:22:57.210 --> 00:23:00.290
What? A lion destroyed
the Lion Guard?

502
00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:02.079
Or so the story goes.

503
00:23:02.079 --> 00:23:04.379
Ha-ha-hilarious!

504
00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:07.830
Yeah! Them lions
ain't too bright!

505
00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.960
Stuff it, fur brains!

506
00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:15.540
A new Lion Guard
could be very bad news
for us hyenas.

507
00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.829
And all the other
Outlanders.

508
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:21.210
I gathered as much
from what I overheard
from Kion.

509
00:23:21.251 --> 00:23:27.041
Yes. The old Lion Guard
protected the so-called
Circle of Life.

510
00:23:27.041 --> 00:23:30.830
If Kion's new Lion Guard wins
the trust of the Pride Lands,

511
00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:32.920
we Outlanders will...

512
00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.420
(GROWLS)

513
00:23:37.879 --> 00:23:39.419
(HYENAS LAUGHING)

514
00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:49.420
Now, Janja.
What were you saying?

515
00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:52.619
About the Lion Guard
and the Outlanders?

516
00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.040
I was saying...

517
00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.420
With a Lion Guard
patrolling the Pride Lands,

520
00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:03.329
Then what're
we gonna do?

521
00:24:03.329 --> 00:24:05.459
Ooh, we could
eat each other.

522
00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:08.000

is ready.

524
00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:13.830

all the animals we can.

00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:16.249

the sound of that.

You bet your spots he did!

634
00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:33.420
Fuli, the Lion Guard
needs you.

635
00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:34.830
You're the Pride Lands'
fastest.

636
00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:36.170
You got that right.

637
00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:38.960
And you're supposed
to be the fiercest?

638
00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:40.669
Well, he is a lion...

639
00:29:40.669 --> 00:29:42.419
And lions are fierce.

640
00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:44.210
It's kinda common
knowledge, really...

641
00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:46.710
Show 'em the Roar, Kion.
Show 'em the Roar!

642
00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:49.420
What's Bunga talking about?
The Roar?

643
00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:54.250
You think you're somethin'
special just 'cause
you can roar?

644
00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:56.710
Wait 'till you hear it.
C'mon, Kion.

645
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:58.000
Show 'em the Roar!

646
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.880
So what is the deal
with your roar?

647
00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:04.209
Oh, you totally
have to show us, Kion.

648
00:30:04.209 --> 00:30:05.789
Seeing is believing!

649
00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:07.460
Though with a roar,
it's more about hearing...

650
00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:11.210
Okay, fine.
I'll show you the Roar.

651
00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:13.790
Just, uh, stay behind me.

652
00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:15.879
I don't want
anybody to get hurt.

That was... Different.

660
00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.250
(LAUGHS) Kion!

661
00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:39.120
You call that a roar?
(CHUCKLES)

662
00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.999
Didn't sound like a roar.

663
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.040
That wasn't the Roar!
That was a squeak!

664
00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:45.830
I've found him,
Your Highness!

665
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:47.420
Kion is over here!

666
00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:49.460
See, Dad?
What did I tell you?

667
00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:50.919
Thank you, Kiara.

668
00:30:50.919 --> 00:30:52.999
You and Tiifu go ahead
and track the gazelle.

669
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.330
I need to talk
with Kion. Alone.

670
00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:56.420
Yes, Dad.

671
00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:57.920
Thank you, princess.

672
00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:00.580
Dad! Am I glad
to see you!

673
00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:02.380
I'm not sure why,
but when I tried to...

674
00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:07.000
Kion, Kiara tells me
you've asked Bunga
to join the Lion Guard.

675
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.290
Hey...

676
00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:09.580
Is this true?

677
00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:11.080
Well, yeah.

678
00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:13.380
I was just talking to all
my friends about it.

679
00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:14.879
Your friends?

680
00:31:14.879 --> 00:31:18.499
Kion, I asked you to assemble
the new Lion Guard.

681
00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:21.170
Instead you're just
playing with your friends?

682
00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:22.580
I'm not playing, Dad.

683
00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:24.500
My friends are
the new Lion Guard.

684
00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:26.120
Fuli is the fastest.

685
00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:27.669
Beshte is the strongest.

686
00:31:27.669 --> 00:31:29.619
Ono is the keenest of sight.

687
00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:32.290
And the bravest, it's Bunga.

688
00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:37.120
Kion, the Lion Guard has
always been made of lions.

689
00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:40.579
Do you really
think a Lion Guard
with only one lion

690
00:31:40.579 --> 00:31:42.039
can protect the Pride Lands?

691
00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:44.620
Well, actually...
Son, listen.

692
00:31:44.661 --> 00:31:47.961
The Lion Guard isn't a game
you play with your friends.

693
00:31:47.961 --> 00:31:49.080
It's real.

694
00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:51.459
The Circle of Life,
and your life,

695
00:31:51.459 --> 00:31:53.709
will depend on
who's on your team.

696
00:31:53.751 --> 00:31:57.501
Please, Kion.
There are plenty of
good lions for the Guard.

697
00:31:57.501 --> 00:32:01.540
I need you to take your
new responsibility seriously.

698
00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:04.119
Just as seriously
as Kiara takes hers.

699
00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:10.960
But I do take it seriously...

700
00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:12.500
Kion...

701
00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:15.880
Lil' B, I think Kion needs
some time to himself.

702
00:32:21.211 --> 00:32:24.501
KIARA: Be sure to
stay low while we're
tracking the herd.

703
00:32:24.501 --> 00:32:27.751
And we need stay downwind,
so they don't catch our scent.

704
00:32:27.751 --> 00:32:30.750
That's why it's important
to watch how the grass moves.

705
00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:34.250
Are we going
to attack them?

706
00:32:34.291 --> 00:32:38.831
No. My dad says
we should only take
what the pride needs,

707
00:32:38.831 --> 00:32:40.749
to keep the Circle
of Life in balance.

708
00:32:40.749 --> 00:32:43.579
If we took down gazelles
just to learn how to do it,

709
00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:45.580
pretty soon there
wouldn't be any left.

710
00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:47.880

as bad as the hyenas.

713

when they're expecting to eat.

714

715

717
00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:04.540
Yeah. And with Mzingo
circling over the gazelles,

718
00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:06.499

they're up to no good.

Go find my dad and tell him
Janja and his clan are here.

721
00:33:11.041 --> 00:33:12.460
I'll stay here

722

Okay, Kiara. Be careful!

723
00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:26.960

<i>Zuka Zamaaaaaa!</i>

866
00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:48.580
Kiara's trapped
behind that rock.

867
00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:50.880
Uhh, I can't get any closer.

868
00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.749
Then this is
where I get off!

869
00:40:52.749 --> 00:40:54.249
Hang on, Kiara!

870
00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:58.380
Whoo! Ha ha!

871
00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:00.460
Aaah!

872
00:41:02.749 --> 00:41:04.459
<i>Zuka Zamaaaaaa!</i>

873
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.790
Bunga? Have you
lost your mind?

874
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:12.580
Never had one, Kiara!

875
00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:14.500
Now, if you don't mind.

876
00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:16.460
Scram ya, goofy gazelles!

877
00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:17.959
Take this!

878
00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:20.420
(HISSING)

879
00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:27.080
Uncle Pumbaa
taught me that one.

880
00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:29.919
(COUGHS) Thanks, Bunga.

881
00:41:29.919 --> 00:41:32.709
You might be stinky,
but you sure are brave.

882
00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:35.500
Kion! Bunga and Fuli did it!

883
00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:37.290
Kiara's safe!

884
00:41:37.331 --> 00:41:39.961
Great! Have them
regroup with us at
the edge of the field.

885
00:41:39.961 --> 00:41:42.119
It's time to give
Janja and his hyenas

886
00:41:42.119 --> 00:41:44.669
something to remember.

887
00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:46.120
Mom! Dad!

888
00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:48.330
Kiara!
You're safe.

889
00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:51.290
I might not be if it weren't
for Kion and his friends.

890
00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:54.789
I guess he knew
what he was doing
when he picked them.

891
00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:56.540
He did, didn't he?

892
00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:58.250
Look! Look!

893
00:42:04.879 --> 00:42:08.619
Well, if it isn't
Kion the lion cub.

894
00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:10.960
You and your friends
better leave now,

895
00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.830
before you get hurt.

896
00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:15.460
We're the Lion Guard, Janja.

897
00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:17.669
We defend
the Circle of Life.

898
00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:20.830
You and your kind
are not welcome
in the Pride Lands.

899
00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:21.880
Ever!

900
00:42:29.709 --> 00:42:32.209

<i>Zuka Zama!
</i> Now that's the Roar!

903
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:47.000
Oh!

904
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.540
Did you hear that?

905
00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:50.880
Kion.
Whoa.

906
00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:53.379
(YELPING)

907
00:42:53.379 --> 00:42:55.709
You win today, Kion.

908
00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:58.460
Next time won't be so easy.

909
00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:02.790
See, Simba? You see?

910
00:43:04.879 --> 00:43:07.499
He is ready!
It is time!

911
00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:09.750
Simba?
Yes.

912
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:11.250
Kion is ready.

913
00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:14.380
It is time.

914
00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:16.500
