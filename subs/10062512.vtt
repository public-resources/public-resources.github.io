We're gonna be late for
the elephants' concert.

7
00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.209
You know it's considered
an insult

8
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.120
if the royal family is
not there for the first song.

9
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.000
The first song's
the best part!

10
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.290
Race you there.
Oh, yeah.

11
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.619
Shall we?

12
00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.249
Yes. But we don't need
to race.

13
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.040
Kion! Kion!

14
00:01:26.081 --> 00:01:29.121
We've got antelopes
stuck in a mud pool
near Chekundu Cliffs.

15
00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:30.250
Anyone hurt?

16
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.380
No, but they're really stuck.

17
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.460
That big rainstorm last night
must've caused a mud slide.

18
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.160
Dad? I'm gonna have to
miss the elephants'
rainy season concert.

19
00:01:39.161 --> 00:01:43.081
It's okay, Kion.
I'm sure the elephants
will understand.

20
00:01:43.081 --> 00:01:46.161
Keeping the animals of
the Pride Lands safe
is your duty.

21
00:01:46.161 --> 00:01:48.079
Right. Let's go, Ono.

22
00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:50.709
Say hi to Ma Tembo
and the elephants for me!

23
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.620
We will.
Stay alert, son!

24
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.000
Come on. We still have
a concert to go to.

25
00:01:56.041 --> 00:02:00.161
Do you think the elephants
will do that song with all
the really loud trumpeting?

26
00:02:00.161 --> 00:02:03.459
They always do the song
with the loud trumpeting.

27
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.120
It's tradition.

28
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.670
Sometimes I think
my greatest duty as King

29
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.040
is upholding the
Pride Lands' traditions.

30
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.999
And one day, it will be
your duty, Princess.

31
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.830
Attending concerts
is one duty
I know I can handle.

There's nothing to grab onto.

How'd you get down there?

There was a sinkhole

Rocks they can climb?
Anything?

121
00:05:44.001 --> 00:05:48.581
Unfortunately, no.
It's just a deep hole

What happened?

184
00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:31.290
Bunga tried to climb
the wall.

185
00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:33.290
'Cause I'm such
a good climber!

186
00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:35.790
Sure, when you're
climbing trees!

187
00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:39.119
Climbing trees. Hmm.

188
00:08:39.161 --> 00:08:42.871
I have an idea.

Be right back, Mom!

189
00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:47.880
Simba! Kion's got a plan
to get you out.

190
00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.539
Just hang in there.

191
00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.620
I don't have a choice.

192

that you have to stay here.

194
00:08:56.121 --> 00:09:00.121
You and Kiara should go on
to the elephants' concert.
We're already late.

195

But they're expecting
all of us.

196
00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.170
What about tradition?

197
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:06.120
The elephants will be honored
to have at least

198
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.920
some of the royal family
in attendance.

199
00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.500
But if none of us show up,
they'll be worried.

200
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.579
Simba, I'm more worried
about you.

201
00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:20.330
I'm fine, Nala.
I'm just stuck in a hole.

202
00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.000
Kion and the Lion Guard
will get me out.

203

must not be ignored.

204

out of there soon.

Then you can just climb up.

Great idea, Kion!

suggests climbing,
it's a great idea?

to lead to the...

353
00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.959
That's King bro to you.

354
00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:07.620
(BOTH LAUGH)

355
00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:10.790
(SIGHS) Too bad
Timon and Pumbaa aren't here

356
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:12.789
to see us finally
getting along.

357
00:16:13.619 --> 00:16:15.169
It would make them happy.

358
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:16.830
(SCOFFS) You know them.

359
00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:20.000
<i>Hakuna matata?
</i> They're always happy!

360
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.750
Why? Why?

361
00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:24.959
Oh, cruel savannah!

362
00:16:24.959 --> 00:16:28.999
To take both our babies
on the same day?

363
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
(CRYING) I know, Timon.
I know!

364
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.420
Fate is a fickle mongoose!

365
00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:38.499
Remind me again. Huh.
Why did you bring them here?

366
00:16:38.499 --> 00:16:40.459
I thought Timon could help.

367
00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:43.040
Meerkats are supposed
to be great in tunnels.

368
00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:48.080
And now we're lost
in this crazy maze.
(CRYING)

369
00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.789
Oh, I'm so turned around

370
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:53.540
I'm afraid we'll never
get out alive!

371
00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:55.880
ONO: Uh, Timon, Pumbaa?

372
00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.420
The entrance to the cave
is right there.

373
00:17:00.289 --> 00:17:04.619
See? Barely inside
and we're already lost!

374
00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:07.170
Not exactly inspiring
confidence, are they?

375
00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:10.170
They're just worried
about Bunga and Simba, Ono.

376
00:17:10.211 --> 00:17:16.421
My kids! Who knows what
horrors they're enduring
down there.

377
00:17:16.421 --> 00:17:17.830
<i>Hakuna...</i>
<i>Matata.</i>

378
00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:19.080
<i>Hakuna...</i>
<i>Matata.</i>

379
00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.500
<i>Hakuna...</i>
<i>Matata.</i>

380
00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:22.250
<i>Hakuna...</i>
<i>Matata.</i>

381
00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:24.959
We should think about this.

382
00:17:24.959 --> 00:17:26.959
Which way, Your Majesty?

383
00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:30.880
Please. You choose, Bunga.
I insist.

384
00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.210
Nah. You're the King.
You choose.

385
00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:37.250
I am the King.
And I say you choose.

386
00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:40.079
TIMON: (CRYING) Why?
Oh, why?

387
00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.420
(GASPS) That sounded like...
Timon?

388
00:17:42.461 --> 00:17:46.211
TIMON: My two babies!
Lost in these
accursed caverns! Forever!

389
00:17:46.211 --> 00:17:47.790
It came from down here!

390
00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:49.669
So what are we waiting for?

391
00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:51.079
Wait for me!

392
00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.500
Sorry, I lost it
back there, Kion.

393
00:17:53.541 --> 00:17:57.541
Oh, you'll understand
when you have kids
of your own.

394
00:17:57.541 --> 00:17:59.420
Well, not exactly your own.

395
00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:03.870
But you'll understand
when a lost lion
or lonely honey badger

396
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:07.040
wanders into your little
corner of the world.

397
00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.120
And you let 'em
into your heart,

398
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.290
you know,
just enough, and...
(SNIFFLES)

399
00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:14.579
(CRYING) And then...

400
00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:18.040
BUNGA: Uncle Pumbaa?
SIMBA: Timon!

401
00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:22.080
Ooh, I can still hear
their sweet, sweet voices.

402
00:18:24.249 --> 00:18:26.079
Dad? Bunga?

403
00:18:26.079 --> 00:18:27.079
BOTH: Kion!

404
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.830
My babies are alive!

405
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:36.170
Don't worry, Simba and Bunga!
We're comin' for ya!

406
00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:38.329
(CRASHING)
PUMBAA: Dead end.

407
00:18:38.329 --> 00:18:41.579
We're still coming for ya!

408
00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:42.920
This way.

409
00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:44.710
Kion!

410
00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:46.290
Dad! Bunga!

411
00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:52.040
Oh, Timon, look! See?
They're okay!

412
00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.920
Uncle Timon! Uncle Pumbaa!

413
00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:55.960
(GRUNTS)

414
00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:00.420
ONO: <i>Hapana!</i>

415
00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:02.749
Should we go back?
Look for another way?

416
00:19:02.749 --> 00:19:05.079
I've got a better idea.
Hop on!

417
00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:06.580
That's your idea?

418
00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:09.670
Actually, it's your idea.
Remember?

419
00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:11.000
Oh, yeah.

420
00:19:12.379 --> 00:19:14.079
I don't believe it.

421
00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:19.750
Hang on! Ow!
Bunga, not the mane.

422
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:21.040
Sorry, bro.

423
00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:23.210
(PANTING)

424
00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:24.879
BOTH: <i>Zuka Zama!</i>

425
00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:29.000
Did we just see...

426
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.330
A honey badger riding
on top of the King?

427
00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:34.460
Like my dad always says,

428
00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:37.880
live long enough,
and you'll see everything.

429
00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.169
Thanks for the lift.

430
00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:40.880
We should do this
again sometime.

431
00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.040
(LAUGHS)

432
00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:45.170
Well, I'll, uh, have Zazu
check my schedule.

433
00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:46.420
(KISSING)

434
00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.080
(KISSING)

435
00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.499
Dad, Bunga?
I thought you guys are...

436
00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.380
Are practically bothers?

437
00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:54.500
Huh?

438
00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.420
Absolutely.

439
00:19:56.461 --> 00:20:00.501
And to think you were worried
that we'd never find them.

440
00:20:00.501 --> 00:20:06.329
I'm sorry.
I should've remembered.
<i>Hakuna matata!</i>

(ALL TRUMPETING)

442
00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:16.119
Bravo! Bravo!

443
00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:18.080
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.790
(ALL TRUMPETING)

445
00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:21.750
We're so glad to
have all of you here

446
00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:24.080
to take part in our tradition.

447
00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.169
We're especially honored

448
00:20:26.169 --> 00:20:30.119
to have members of the
royal family in attendance.

449
00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.920
We wouldn't miss it.

450
00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.670
The King was very
disappointed to miss
this event.

451
00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:36.330
He planned to be here...

452
00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:40.749
Animals plan,
and the savannah laughs.

453
00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:43.830
Indeed. We're grateful
for your understanding.

454
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:45.120
SIMBA: Sorry we're late!

455
00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.790
Simba?
Daddy?

456
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:51.119
Your Majesty. Kion.

457
00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.920
And, uh...

458
00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.330
Bunga. Brother to the King.

459
00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:57.830
Brother?

460
00:20:57.830 --> 00:21:00.120
Just call me
Uncle Bunga.

461
00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.249
What exactly happened
in that pit?

462
00:21:02.249 --> 00:21:05.209
It was quite an adventure.

463
00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:08.040
Thank you for your patience,
Ma Tembo.

464
00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:11.040
And I thank all of you,
my friends.

465
00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:14.000
I know how important
music is to elephants.

466
00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:17.160
And I'm deeply honored to be
included in your tradition.

467
00:21:17.161 --> 00:21:20.711
But since I missed
your only concert
of the season,

468
00:21:20.711 --> 00:21:24.041
I'd like to share a song
that means a great deal
to my family.

469
00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:26.959
All my family.

470
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.620
We would be honored
to hear your song,
Your Majesty.
