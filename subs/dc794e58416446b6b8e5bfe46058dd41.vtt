those dust devils,

I wish we could,

43
00:02:40.331 --> 00:02:42.920

when a dust devil's
gonna happen,

44
00:02:42.921 --> 00:02:44.290

00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:06.380

what I suggested.

Yeah. Yeah, the party.
Right.

179
00:08:17.581 --> 00:08:20.540
So, do not go anywhere, okay?

180
00:08:20.541 --> 00:08:23.460
I will be right here
when you return.

182
00:08:24.711 --> 00:08:29.000
Uh, and, uh, where did you say
those flowers were. (LAUGHS)

183
00:08:29.001 --> 00:08:31.620
The ones that make
the Lion Guard sneeze.

184
00:08:31.621 --> 00:08:34.580
Ah, yes.
They're right next
to the place

185
00:08:34.581 --> 00:08:36.710
with that big thing
with all that stuff on it.

186
00:08:36.711 --> 00:08:39.040
Oh, yeah.
I know that place.

187
00:08:39.041 --> 00:08:42.460
Then let's get going!
Come on!

188
00:08:42.461 --> 00:08:45.460
I hope they don't bring
any of those flowers here.

189
00:08:45.461 --> 00:08:48.920
I'm not fond of the smell,
and they make me sneeze.

190
00:08:48.921 --> 00:08:50.250
Wait!

191
00:08:50.251 --> 00:08:53.830
Was it the Lion Guard
who sneezed at the flowers

192
00:08:53.831 --> 00:08:55.830
or was it me?
Oh, well.

193
00:08:55.831 --> 00:08:59.040
Either way, it makes for
a fascinating story.

He might be more
willing to relax

It looks like
they brought us flowers.

Should we have gotten
them something?

215

That's right!
We got flowers

to use them.

A party?
Yes.

274
00:12:12.961 --> 00:12:16.040
Because I'm an expert
on the Lion Guard.

275
00:12:16.041 --> 00:12:20.040
The hyenas especially
enjoyed hearing about
their weaknesses.

The Lion Guard has weaknesses?

Oh, yes.

278
00:12:24.001 --> 00:12:26.460
You know, sometimes
they run right past me,

279
00:12:26.461 --> 00:12:27.920
like they don't see me
at all.

280
00:12:27.921 --> 00:12:29.670
It's my stripes, of course.

281
00:12:29.671 --> 00:12:32.750
They make me invisible
to lots of animals,

282
00:12:32.751 --> 00:12:34.830
including the Lion Guard.

283
00:12:34.831 --> 00:12:36.670
Invisible, huh?

284
00:12:36.671 --> 00:12:38.620
So, you can say
you sneak up
on all of them,

285
00:12:38.621 --> 00:12:40.290
and they never see you coming?

286
00:12:40.291 --> 00:12:42.290
Well, perhaps.
But you see there's...

287
00:12:42.291 --> 00:12:45.540
So your stripes would
let you take the whole
Lion Guard by surprise

288
00:12:45.541 --> 00:12:47.170
and defeat them
all by yourself?

289
00:12:47.171 --> 00:12:49.040
I suppose.

290
00:12:49.041 --> 00:12:51.750
But why would anyone
want to do that?

291
00:12:51.751 --> 00:12:54.040
'Cause it would really
be doing something,

292
00:12:54.041 --> 00:12:57.080
and then Reirei would know
I ain't a do-nothing.

293
00:12:57.081 --> 00:12:58.620

00:12:58.621 --> 00:13:00.080

get me some stripes?

Hmm.

299
00:13:09.041 --> 00:13:13.080
I wonder if I told my stripes
only make me invisible

300
00:13:13.081 --> 00:13:15.420
when I'm surrounded
by other zebras?

301
00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.620

at the party.

00:15:41.751 --> 00:15:43.210
You were invited?

351
00:15:43.211 --> 00:15:46.500
Not just invited,
I am the guest of honor.

352
00:15:46.501 --> 00:15:49.460
Because I'm the Pride Lands
Lion Guard expert.

353
00:15:49.461 --> 00:15:51.620
I know everything about them.

354
00:15:51.621 --> 00:15:52.790
Everything?

355
00:15:52.791 --> 00:15:55.040
Oh, let me guess.

356
00:15:55.041 --> 00:15:58.080
You want to hear about
their weak points, too.

357
00:15:58.081 --> 00:15:59.460
Uh, okay.

358
00:15:59.461 --> 00:16:02.170
Although, I'm sort of
running out of them...

359
00:16:02.171 --> 00:16:03.580
Oh! I know!

360
00:16:03.581 --> 00:16:07.000
I heard somewhere
that if you rub their tummies,

361
00:16:07.001 --> 00:16:09.250
they'll all fall
fast asleep.

362
00:16:09.251 --> 00:16:11.170
You believe it?
Sure.

363
00:16:11.171 --> 00:16:12.830
I mean, it works on me.

364
00:16:12.831 --> 00:16:15.170
Hey, we should
tell Kiburi.

365
00:16:15.171 --> 00:16:17.710
No! We ought to fight
the Lion Guard.

366
00:16:17.711 --> 00:16:20.040
Put 'em to sleep
and hand them over
to Scar

367
00:16:20.041 --> 00:16:21.880
all by ourselves.

368
00:16:21.881 --> 00:16:25.830
Then maybe next time,
we'll get to go
to the big meeting.

369
00:16:25.831 --> 00:16:27.120
Yeah, good idea.

370
00:16:27.121 --> 00:16:28.710
See you around,
zebra.

371
00:16:28.711 --> 00:16:30.540
Ta-ta, crocodiles.

372
00:16:30.541 --> 00:16:32.080
Oh, yes.

373
00:16:32.081 --> 00:16:35.710
Rubbing my tummy
always puts me to sleep.

374
00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:38.080
(GASPS)

375
00:16:38.081 --> 00:16:41.290
Gracious! Was I talking
about me again?

376
00:16:41.291 --> 00:16:43.380
(GASPS) Oh, well...

377
00:16:43.381 --> 00:16:46.790
Don't worry, Mbuni,
I'm almost there!

378
00:16:46.791 --> 00:16:49.040
(EXCLAIMS, LAUGHS)

379
00:16:49.041 --> 00:16:50.380
Oh, at last.

380
00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:54.830
Thank you, Lion Guard.
Thank you.

381
00:16:54.831 --> 00:16:56.080
Just doing our job.

382
00:16:56.081 --> 00:17:00.080
We won't be needing another
dust-bath for a while.

383
00:17:00.081 --> 00:17:03.170
Okay, everybody,
time for a break.

384
00:17:03.171 --> 00:17:04.500
Sounds good to me.

385
00:17:04.501 --> 00:17:07.580
(GROWLING)
Oh, come on!
Now, these guys?

386
00:17:07.581 --> 00:17:09.710
(BOTH GROWLING)

387
00:17:09.711 --> 00:17:11.040
Seriously?

388
00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.210
What do you want?

389
00:17:14.211 --> 00:17:16.210
You'll see soon enough!

390
00:17:16.211 --> 00:17:19.040
That's right!
We're gonna put you...

391
00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:22.500
to sleep.
(EXCLAIMS) What in
the Pride Lands?

392
00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:25.960
Sleep.
(LAUGHS)

393
00:17:25.961 --> 00:17:28.080
What kind of fighting
do you call this?

394
00:17:28.081 --> 00:17:30.250
Uh, Tamka,
this ain't working.

395
00:17:30.251 --> 00:17:32.750
Keep trying. Maybe,
it takes a while to kick in.

396
00:17:32.751 --> 00:17:35.170
You're getting sleepy.

397
00:17:35.171 --> 00:17:36.960
When you guys wake up,

398
00:17:36.961 --> 00:17:39.040
you'll be facing Scar.

399
00:17:39.041 --> 00:17:40.170
Are they serious?

400
00:17:40.171 --> 00:17:41.580
Apparently so.

401
00:17:41.581 --> 00:17:43.710
So, go to sleep already!

402
00:17:43.711 --> 00:17:47.380
Yeah, we rubbed your tubbies.
Why're you still awake?

403
00:17:47.381 --> 00:17:49.460
That's why you're trying
to rub out tummies?

404
00:17:49.461 --> 00:17:51.620
What's going on
with you guys today?

405
00:17:51.621 --> 00:17:54.210
Sleepy...
That's it!

I can't wait
to get home.

408
00:18:01.831 --> 00:18:05.380
I'm still aching all over.
CHUNGU: Me too.

409
00:18:05.381 --> 00:18:07.750

know his own...

(GOIGOI CRYING)

412
00:18:12.001 --> 00:18:14.710
Goigoi, what is
wrong with you?

413
00:18:14.711 --> 00:18:16.960
I ran into the Lion Guard.

414
00:18:16.961 --> 00:18:19.960
Or the Lion Guard ran into me!

415
00:18:19.961 --> 00:18:21.580
What happened to you?

416
00:18:21.581 --> 00:18:25.250
We got bounced around
good by the Lion Guard.

417
00:18:25.251 --> 00:18:29.790
And it's all that lousy,
no-good, zebras fault.

418
00:18:29.791 --> 00:18:33.830
Zebra? Did that donkey
with stripes trick
you guys too?

419
00:18:33.831 --> 00:18:35.290
He sure did.

420
00:18:35.291 --> 00:18:40.380
That snooty, striped bag
of hot air is good
for nothing!

421
00:18:40.381 --> 00:18:41.880
Except for eating maybe.

422
00:18:41.881 --> 00:18:44.880
That's the first good idea
I've heard all day.

423
00:18:44.881 --> 00:18:47.250
(LAUGHING) Then what are
we waiting for?

424
00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:49.380
It's lunchtime!

425
00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:52.290
Kion? What's
the kurbubble?

426
00:18:52.291 --> 00:18:54.540
All those crazy attacks.

427
00:18:54.541 --> 00:18:57.670
Scar's got to be
up to something.
But what?

428
00:18:57.671 --> 00:18:59.960
What makes you think
Scar's involved?

429
00:18:59.961 --> 00:19:04.000
'Cause those guys don't do
anything unless somebody
smarter tells them to.

430
00:19:04.001 --> 00:19:08.120
But why would Scar
send them after us
on such silly missions?

431
00:19:08.121 --> 00:19:10.540
Maybe he's up to something
really big,

432
00:19:10.541 --> 00:19:13.420
and he's just trying
to keep us distracted.

433
00:19:13.421 --> 00:19:15.250
Ono, take a look
at the Outlands.

434
00:19:15.251 --> 00:19:17.080
See if there's anything
going on.

435
00:19:17.081 --> 00:19:18.380
Affirmative.

436
00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:21.790
Hmm.

437
00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:24.380
Oh!

438
00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:27.580
That doesn't look good.

439
00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:31.420
No sign of any big attack.

440
00:19:31.421 --> 00:19:34.000
But I did see a zebra
in the Outlands.

441
00:19:34.001 --> 00:19:35.460
A zebra?
Yes.

442
00:19:35.461 --> 00:19:39.460
And he's surrounded
by Chungu, Cheezi, Goigoi,
Tamka, and Nduli.

443
00:19:39.461 --> 00:19:41.080
Did you recognize the zebra?

444
00:19:41.081 --> 00:19:42.580
It was, uh...

445
00:19:42.581 --> 00:19:45.330
(IMITATING THURSTON)
"Panic and run!
Panic and run!"

446
00:19:45.331 --> 00:19:46.750
That guy?

447
00:19:46.751 --> 00:19:48.500
I know what
you're thinking,
Fuli.

448
00:19:48.501 --> 00:19:50.330
But he's still
a Pride Lander.

449
00:19:50.331 --> 00:19:52.620
We've got to save him.
Come on!

450
00:19:52.621 --> 00:19:55.580
Now are we going
to this party or not?

451
00:19:55.581 --> 00:19:57.540
Don't worry, zebra.

452
00:19:57.541 --> 00:19:59.830
We're gonna have
a party, all right.

453
00:19:59.831 --> 00:20:01.290
Listen, if we're
gonna do this,

454
00:20:01.291 --> 00:20:02.710
there's got to be
a fair split.

455
00:20:02.711 --> 00:20:06.080
How's about the hyenas
get the ribs and brisket,

456
00:20:06.081 --> 00:20:08.960
the crocs get the shanks
and I get the rump.

457
00:20:08.961 --> 00:20:11.500
No way! We want the rump.

458
00:20:11.501 --> 00:20:14.330
I want a wing.
THURSTON: I couldn't help
but overhear.

459
00:20:14.331 --> 00:20:17.040
If you want to know
the tastiest part
of a zebra,

460
00:20:17.041 --> 00:20:18.380
ask a zebra.

461
00:20:18.381 --> 00:20:22.420
Now, I've always been told
that my tri-tip is espe...

462
00:20:22.421 --> 00:20:24.000
TAMKA: Shut it, zebra.

463
00:20:24.001 --> 00:20:26.830
We're sick of your
ridiculous stories.

464
00:20:26.831 --> 00:20:29.710
Well, no need
to be rude.

465
00:20:29.711 --> 00:20:32.830
I'm just trying to be
entertaining and informative.

466
00:20:32.831 --> 00:20:35.210
I don't even know
what those words mean.

467
00:20:35.211 --> 00:20:36.880
Back off and hush up.

468
00:20:36.881 --> 00:20:38.210
Now, where were we?

469
00:20:38.211 --> 00:20:40.500
Figuring out
who gets the wing.

470
00:20:40.501 --> 00:20:41.620
THURSTON: Excuse me.

471
00:20:41.621 --> 00:20:45.080
Yoo-hoo.
One last word of advice?

472
00:20:45.081 --> 00:20:46.620
(GROANS) What?

473
00:20:46.621 --> 00:20:48.790
Panic and run.

474
00:20:48.791 --> 00:20:51.830
That's three words.
KION:
But its good advice.

475
00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:54.580
We're here to take
the zebra home.

00:20:54.581 --> 00:20:56.580
Don't make is do it
the hard way.

to a party?

That's right.

we fall asleep.
