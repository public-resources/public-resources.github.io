2
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.710
The Pride Lands will never end
while the Lion Guard is here.

3
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.290
Just like this tiny tree,
we'll keep growing stronger.

4
00:00:51.291 --> 00:00:53.250
Scar will never defeat us!

5
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.830
We'll never give up.

6
00:00:55.831 --> 00:00:57.670
We'll fight for what's right.

7
00:00:57.671 --> 00:01:00.170
We'll defend
the Circle of Life!

8
00:01:00.171 --> 00:01:02.540
Yeah! What you guys said!

00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:03.580
ANGA: Lion Guard!

10
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.420
Anga? What's going on?

11
00:01:08.421 --> 00:01:10.500
One of the bird patrols
spotted Scar's army.

12
00:01:10.501 --> 00:01:12.000
Near Mapango Cliffs.

13
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:13.670
Then that's where we're going.

14
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.880

Well done, Kion. Lion Guard.

44
00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:49.790
Your Majesty.
Thanks, Dad.

45
00:02:49.791 --> 00:02:51.500
Yes, yes!

46
00:02:51.501 --> 00:02:54.460
Kion and the Lion Guard
are growing up.

47
00:02:54.461 --> 00:02:58.080
And Kion's Roar
is more powerful than ever.

48
00:02:58.081 --> 00:03:00.120
Yes. That's true.

49
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.420
Dad? What is it?

50
00:03:03.421 --> 00:03:04.920
You and the Guard
have proven

51
00:03:04.921 --> 00:03:06.670
you can defend
the Pride Lands.

52
00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:09.330
But it hasn't stopped
Scar's army.

53
00:03:09.331 --> 00:03:10.830
We need a change in strategy.

54
00:03:10.831 --> 00:03:12.420
I say,

55
00:03:12.421 --> 00:03:15.620
we take the fight with Scar
into the Outlands.

56
00:03:15.621 --> 00:03:16.710
(BOTH GASP)

57
00:03:16.711 --> 00:03:18.000
<i> Hapana.</i>
No way.

58
00:03:18.001 --> 00:03:19.080
Seriously?

59
00:03:19.081 --> 00:03:21.000
'Bout time if you ask me.

60
00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:22.380
It is time.

61
00:03:22.381 --> 00:03:25.420
Time to defeat Scar
and his followers.

62
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:26.880
Once and for all.

63
00:03:26.881 --> 00:03:29.670
Dad, even if we defeat
Scar's army,

64
00:03:29.671 --> 00:03:31.750
we don't know
how to defeat Scar himself.

65
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:34.880
Without his followers,
Scar will be powerless

66
00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:37.670
and we can have peace
in the Pride Lands once again.

67
00:03:37.671 --> 00:03:39.330
We can help, too,
Your Majesty.

68
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.290
My hyenas know the Outlands
better than anyone.

69
00:03:42.291 --> 00:03:43.920
Thank you, Jasiri.

70
00:03:43.921 --> 00:03:45.250
Well...

71
00:03:45.251 --> 00:03:46.540
I guess if everyone

72
00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:49.000
who respects
the Circle of Life helps us...

73
00:03:49.001 --> 00:03:51.420
Yes! Yes! Everyone can help!

74
00:03:51.421 --> 00:03:52.620
Right.

75
00:03:52.621 --> 00:03:53.710
Lion Guard,

76
00:03:53.711 --> 00:03:55.580
we need everyone
who's willing to fight.

77
00:03:55.581 --> 00:03:57.330
I'll get the crocs
and antelopes.

78
00:03:57.331 --> 00:03:59.420
I'll talk to the elephants
and rhinos.

79
00:03:59.421 --> 00:04:01.540
Anga and I
will assemble the birds.

80
00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:03.120
And I'll get the galagos.

81
00:04:03.121 --> 00:04:04.920
Galagos?

82
00:04:04.921 --> 00:04:06.380
I know what you're thinking.

83
00:04:06.381 --> 00:04:08.420
But if we're invading
the Outlands,

84
00:04:08.421 --> 00:04:09.670
we'll need all the help
we can get.

85
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.000
Invade the Outlands?

86
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:15.330
We better tell Scar.

87
00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.960
CHEEZI: Janja!

88
00:04:19.961 --> 00:04:22.380
Why can't we go back to our
den in the Outlands?

89
00:04:22.381 --> 00:04:25.920
Yeah, it's nice
and warm back there.

90
00:04:25.921 --> 00:04:28.500
'Cause Scar wants us
to guard this dump.

91
00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:31.670
So the Lion Guard can't
reclaim it for the elephants.

92
00:04:31.671 --> 00:04:34.380
(GRUNTS) The Lion Guard?

93
00:04:34.381 --> 00:04:37.080
I'm tired of always
havin' to fight them.

94
00:04:37.081 --> 00:04:39.580
Yeah! They keep
kickin' our tails!

95
00:04:39.581 --> 00:04:41.710
It's even worse
now that they're bigger.

96
00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.380
Kion's roar
has gotten bigger, too.

97
00:04:45.381 --> 00:04:48.460
And he's got lots
of other animals helping him.

98
00:04:48.461 --> 00:04:50.420
Even Jasiri and her hyenas!

99
00:04:50.421 --> 00:04:52.330
Yeah, yeah. I know. I know.

100
00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.540
Maybe Jasiri was right.

101
00:04:55.541 --> 00:04:59.000
Her hyenas seem to be happy
working with the Lion Guard.

102
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.830
Wonder if we would be, too.

Oh, never mind, furbrains.

154

SCAR: What an interesting
turn of events.

155
00:07:16.791 --> 00:07:19.540
Wouldn't you say so, Ushari?

156
00:07:19.541 --> 00:07:22.170
With the Lion Guard preparing
to attack the Outlands?

157

wanted to see me?

But the Lion Guard just
kicked our tails this morning.

Maybe we could lay off
of 'em for a bit?

170
00:07:54.381 --> 00:07:56.750
Give me and the boys
some time to recover?

171
00:07:56.751 --> 00:07:59.880
The Lion Guard is planning
to attack the Outlands.

172
00:07:59.881 --> 00:08:01.290
Perhaps they've learned

173
00:08:01.291 --> 00:08:03.580
that Kion is now
powerful enough

174
00:08:03.581 --> 00:08:05.330
to destroy me.

175
00:08:05.331 --> 00:08:06.880
Kion can destroy you?

176
00:08:06.881 --> 00:08:08.580
Oh, yes.

177
00:08:08.581 --> 00:08:10.210
But Kion would have to use

178
00:08:10.211 --> 00:08:13.790
the most powerful roar
he can muster.

179
00:08:13.791 --> 00:08:17.380
And it would have to be here,
in the Caldera.

180
00:08:17.381 --> 00:08:21.670
The fire of the volcano
would utterly consume me.

181
00:08:21.671 --> 00:08:26.290
I'd cease to exist.

182
00:08:26.291 --> 00:08:28.750
Really? Oh...

183
00:08:28.751 --> 00:08:30.500
So...

184
00:08:30.501 --> 00:08:34.880
It's time for the final battle
against the Pride Lands.

185
00:08:34.881 --> 00:08:39.580
Time to say goodbye
to Simba and the Royal Family!

186
00:08:39.581 --> 00:08:40.620
But...

187
00:08:40.621 --> 00:08:42.580
I'll need the hyenas

188
00:08:42.581 --> 00:08:46.960
to distract the Lion Guard
for the plan to work.

189
00:08:46.961 --> 00:08:48.500
Just distract them?

190
00:08:48.501 --> 00:08:51.830
You merely have to lure them
into their Lair

191
00:08:51.831 --> 00:08:53.080
and keep them there

192
00:08:53.081 --> 00:08:56.710
while the rest
of the plan unfolds.

193
00:08:56.711 --> 00:08:58.620
I suppose we could do that...

194
00:08:58.621 --> 00:08:59.710
Excellent!

195
00:08:59.711 --> 00:09:03.170
Shupavu will lead you
to Lion Guard Lair tonight.

196
00:09:03.171 --> 00:09:04.500
Now, go!

197
00:09:04.501 --> 00:09:05.710
Prepare your hyenas!

198
00:09:05.711 --> 00:09:07.040
Uh, okay, Scar.

199
00:09:07.041 --> 00:09:08.710
In the meantime, Shupavu,

200
00:09:08.711 --> 00:09:12.500
fetch me Reirei,
Kiburi and Mzingo.

201
00:09:12.501 --> 00:09:15.750
We will need
their help as well.

202
00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:17.880
Yes, Scar.

203
00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:24.420
If the plan works,
we'll soon be rid

204
00:09:24.421 --> 00:09:27.960
of the Royal Family
and the Lion Guard.

205
00:09:27.961 --> 00:09:32.580
And a potential hyena revolt.

206
00:09:32.581 --> 00:09:35.120
And if the plan doesn't work?

207
00:09:35.121 --> 00:09:38.790
I'm two steps ahead, Ushari.

208
00:09:38.791 --> 00:09:43.420
I already have
another plan in place.

209

Hadithi has just arrived

216
00:10:14.921 --> 00:10:17.670
with the gorilla warrior,
Shujaa.

217
00:10:17.671 --> 00:10:18.790
That's everyone.

218
00:10:18.791 --> 00:10:20.000
Indeed.

219
00:10:20.001 --> 00:10:23.460
The Lion Guard has gathered
all the other herds.

220
00:10:23.461 --> 00:10:24.540
Excellent.

221
00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:26.750
Kion, I want you
to lead the attack

222
00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:28.170
first thing tomorrow morning.

223
00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.920
Zazu, tell everyone
to get some rest.

224
00:10:31.921 --> 00:10:33.460
We'll need them at their best
in the morning.

225
00:10:33.461 --> 00:10:35.040
Yes, sire.

226
00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:40.790
With this many animals here,

227
00:10:40.791 --> 00:10:42.830
I'm sure Scar will know
we're coming.

228
00:10:42.831 --> 00:10:45.210
Yeah. You're probably
right about that.

229
00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:46.960
Are you okay, son?

230
00:10:46.961 --> 00:10:49.330
Everyone knows the plan
against the Outlanders.

231
00:10:49.331 --> 00:10:51.920
I just wish we knew how
to defeat Scar himself.

232
00:10:51.921 --> 00:10:53.460
Don't worry, Kion.

233
00:10:53.461 --> 00:10:56.170
I know you and the Lion Guard
will succeed.

234
00:10:56.171 --> 00:10:58.710
I wouldn't ask you to do this
if I wasn't certain.

235
00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.620
Thanks, Dad.

236
00:11:00.621 --> 00:11:01.710
Now, go on.

237
00:11:01.711 --> 00:11:04.380

to get some rest, too.

a lot of Pride Landers

us attack 'em now.

308
00:14:41.581 --> 00:14:43.460
Yeah. I mean...

309
00:14:43.461 --> 00:14:45.380
We still don't know
how to beat Scar.

310
00:14:45.381 --> 00:14:47.750
I don't even know
if he can be beaten.

311

Even when
it's a lion made of fire?

313

I believe
you can do anything, Kion.

314

Just stay true
to who you are inside.

with fire.

is the Lion Guard Lair.

for Scar's plan to work.

321
00:15:26.171 --> 00:15:30.170
Which means you'll need
to get their attention.

322

and his hyenas.

for Pride Rock.

Get the rest of the Guard!

about this, Janja?

337

Sure, I'm sure.

338

right there, hyenas!

Yeah, I see 'em, furbrain.

from getting into their Lair.

I dunno.

00:16:22.711 --> 00:16:25.120

'em up to something.

Hey!

355
00:16:44.881 --> 00:16:47.080
This place is nicer

356
00:16:47.081 --> 00:16:49.120

That's far enough, Janja.

358
00:16:51.251 --> 00:16:53.080
Yeah! Get outta our Lair.

(HYENAS LAUGHING)

362
00:16:59.331 --> 00:17:01.250
They must be after
something in the Lair.

363
00:17:01.251 --> 00:17:02.920
But what?
Doesn't matter.

364
00:17:02.921 --> 00:17:04.920

Huh?

382
00:17:41.001 --> 00:17:43.500
Scar didn't say nothin' 'bout
a fire while we was in here.

But Scar told us
to go in there...

389
00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:01.170
We've been double-crossed!

390
00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:02.540
I gotta get help.

391
00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.620
But the Pride Landers
won't trust me.

392
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:09.210
And I can't trust
Scar's army!

393
00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:12.750
I know who to trust.

394
00:18:12.751 --> 00:18:14.500
Ya think we should
jump through it?

395
00:18:14.501 --> 00:18:15.580
No!

396
00:18:15.581 --> 00:18:17.380
That fire's too hot.

397
00:18:17.381 --> 00:18:19.330
Even I'm not that dumb.

402
00:18:25.881 --> 00:18:28.420
Kion? The whole Lair
is filling with smoke.

403
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:30.710
Use the Roar
to blast us outta here.

404
00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:33.170
And risk having
the whole Lair
collapse on us?

405
00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:34.380
I don't think so.

406
00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.580
There's gotta be
another way out.

Well, we better
find one soon...

of Pride Rock is on fire.

00:18:44.251 --> 00:18:47.290

my mom, dad

412
00:18:47.291 --> 00:18:48.250
Affirmative!

Whoa! <i> Hapana...</i>

Oh, no!

Ono! You're okay!
Anga?

416
00:19:02.121 --> 00:19:03.290
We chased off the vultures.

417
00:19:03.291 --> 00:19:05.080
But not before
they hit Pride Rock.

418
00:19:05.081 --> 00:19:06.170
What do we do?

419
00:19:06.171 --> 00:19:07.880
Kion's already
given me orders.

420
00:19:07.881 --> 00:19:09.170
We have to help
the Royal Family.

421
00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:13.580
Your majesties,
are you okay?

422
00:19:13.581 --> 00:19:15.250
For the moment.

423
00:19:15.251 --> 00:19:18.250
You wouldn't have any idea
how to help us get down
from here?

424
00:19:18.251 --> 00:19:20.250
No. I'm afraid not.

425
00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:22.250
I do.

426
00:19:22.251 --> 00:19:23.330
You first.

427
00:19:23.331 --> 00:19:25.420
Hey, wait! Whoaa!

428
00:19:25.421 --> 00:19:27.500
Uh, Anga? Be careful!

429
00:19:27.501 --> 00:19:29.330
Always am! Be right back.

430
00:19:29.331 --> 00:19:30.330
Don't go anywhere.

431
00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:33.080
Kion? (COUGHS)

432
00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:34.580
Any ideas?

433
00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.750
The fire's too hot
to get close.

434
00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:38.380
We'll need
to wait it out.

435
00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:40.380
Hey! We could use the water

436
00:19:40.381 --> 00:19:41.790
from Beshte's pool
to put it out.

437
00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:43.040
See?

438
00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.120
Seriously?

439
00:19:45.121 --> 00:19:47.210
Once the fire
gets close enough?

440
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:49.080
I was thinkin'.

441
00:19:49.081 --> 00:19:51.250
The water in my pool
has to come from somewhere.

442
00:19:51.251 --> 00:19:52.710
Like somewhere
outside the Lair?

443
00:19:52.711 --> 00:19:54.290
Sure.

444
00:19:54.291 --> 00:19:56.210
The stream that leads
to Lake Shangaza's
not too far from here.

445
00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:58.710
Seems like a good time
to find out if it does.

446
00:19:58.711 --> 00:20:00.080
Be right back.

447
00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:02.330
Your majesties.

448
00:20:02.331 --> 00:20:03.920
Anga says you could
use a lift?

449
00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:05.460
You could say that.

450
00:20:05.461 --> 00:20:06.380
Well, Anga.

451
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:09.420

can handle one lion.

what we're planning.

534
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:57.210
Fiery lion, scary.

535
00:23:57.211 --> 00:23:58.330
What do we do?

536
00:23:58.331 --> 00:24:00.120
Perhaps we should
call off the attack.

537
00:24:00.121 --> 00:24:02.380
No. Everyone, listen.

538
00:24:02.381 --> 00:24:04.620
Scar's just trying
to scare you!

539
00:24:04.621 --> 00:24:06.000
Well, it's working.

540
00:24:06.001 --> 00:24:08.540
If he can set
Pride Rock on fire,

541
00:24:08.541 --> 00:24:10.670
what chance do we have
against him?

542
00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:13.920
Kion? We do know
how to defeat Scar.

543
00:24:13.921 --> 00:24:15.380
Don't we?

544
00:24:15.381 --> 00:24:16.500
Well...

545
00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:18.670

546
00:24:18.671 --> 00:24:20.540
JANJA: I think I can
help you out there.

547
00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.210
Janja?

548
00:24:23.211 --> 00:24:25.500
Janja, you came back!

549
00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:27.460
We knew you would.

550
00:24:27.461 --> 00:24:28.710

551
00:24:28.711 --> 00:24:30.880
Jasiri? What's going on?

552
00:24:30.881 --> 00:24:32.380
I know it sounds odd.

553
00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:35.080
But I think you should hear
what Janja has to say.

554
00:24:35.081 --> 00:24:37.620
Janja? What brings you here?

555
00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.330
I, uh...

556
00:24:39.331 --> 00:24:41.460
I know some stuff
that might be helpful.

557
00:24:41.461 --> 00:24:42.750
Helpful how?

558
00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:45.500
I know how to defeat Scar.

559
00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:48.920
And why should
we believe you?

560
00:24:48.921 --> 00:24:51.000
A sworn enemy
of the Pride Lands.

561
00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:52.880

562
00:24:52.881 --> 00:24:54.580

Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Right...

568
00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:10.960
No offence, Jasiri.

569
00:25:10.961 --> 00:25:15.080
But it is difficult for me
to believe that Janja
has changed sides.

570
00:25:15.081 --> 00:25:18.540
Your Highness,
you gave me a chance

571
00:25:18.541 --> 00:25:20.880
when no one else
in the Pride Lands would.

572
00:25:20.881 --> 00:25:23.620
If Janja's information
is useful,

573
00:25:23.621 --> 00:25:26.210
we should use it to beat Scar.

574
00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:27.580
If it isn't?

575
00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.080

will be happy

If Jasiri believes Janja,

580
00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.330
I think we should at least
hear what he has to say.

581
00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:41.710
Kion.

582
00:25:41.711 --> 00:25:44.040
Always willing
to forgive your enemies.

583
00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:45.830
It is a noble trait.

584
00:25:45.831 --> 00:25:47.540
And part of what
makes you, you.

585
00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:49.960
Very well. Janja.

586
00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:52.830
Okay. Well Scar says

587
00:25:52.831 --> 00:25:55.330
that only Kion can defeat him.

588
00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:57.790
By using the Roar.

589
00:25:57.791 --> 00:26:00.040
If the Roar brought Scar back,

590
00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:02.620
I guess it could get
rid of him, too.

591
00:26:02.621 --> 00:26:06.790
But it's gotta be
the most powerful Roar
you've got.

592
00:26:06.791 --> 00:26:08.080
Oh, yeah!

593
00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:10.500
Just blast Scar
with the Roar.

594
00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:14.790
And you gotta Roar
inside the top of the volcano.

595
00:26:14.791 --> 00:26:18.790
So the flames of the volcano
overwhelm Scar.

596
00:26:18.791 --> 00:26:21.170
The top of the volcano?
Huh?

597
00:26:21.171 --> 00:26:23.790
Getting there
won't be easy.
Indeed.

598
00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:27.710
All the more reason
to proceed with the plan
to attack the Outlands.

599
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:31.750
Yeah. But now it's not
just about defeating
Scar's army.

600
00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:34.710
We have a plan
to defeat Scar as well.

601
00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:36.750
The hyenas
will help too, Kion.

602
00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:39.540
Right?
Yeah. That's right.

603
00:26:39.541 --> 00:26:41.210
All of the hyenas will help.

Tomorrow, we go
into the Outlands.

609
00:26:49.541 --> 00:26:52.500
Scar and his forces
will be defeated,

610

SCAR: So predictable.

619
00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:24.580
Janja has joined
the Pride Landers.

620
00:27:24.581 --> 00:27:26.540
And, you're okay with that?

621
00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.960
I mean, of course
you're okay with that.

622
00:27:29.961 --> 00:27:33.830
Kion may have the power
to defeat me.

623
00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:37.500
But not the way I told Janja.

624
00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.460
If Kion uses
his most powerful Roar

625
00:27:40.461 --> 00:27:44.580
here in the Caldera,
it won't destroy me.

626
00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:48.790
Instead, he'll cause
an eruption so huge

627
00:27:48.791 --> 00:27:51.880
it will destroy
the Lion Guard.

628
00:27:51.881 --> 00:27:56.170

into a wasteland.

00:41:28.581 --> 00:41:30.790
We all will.
Thanks, everyone.

884
00:41:30.791 --> 00:41:32.710
Go ahead, Kion.
We'll make sure

885
00:41:32.711 --> 00:41:34.750
the rest of
the Pride Landers
get home safe.

886
00:41:34.751 --> 00:41:37.500
Thanks, Jasiri.
For everything.

887
00:41:37.501 --> 00:41:40.960
Thank you, Kion.
<i> Asante.</i>

888
00:41:46.290 --> 00:41:48.460
Ow! Still hurts.

889
00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:55.040
<i> Heyvi kabisa.</i>

890
00:41:55.041 --> 00:41:58.250
The mark.
It's just like Scar's.

891
00:41:58.251 --> 00:41:59.460
BUNGA: Kion!

892
00:41:59.461 --> 00:42:01.540
Could Scar be right?

893
00:42:01.541 --> 00:42:04.790
Am I destined
to turn to evil?
Just like he did?

894
00:42:04.791 --> 00:42:06.460
Hey, Kion, c'mon!
Hurry up!

895
00:42:06.461 --> 00:42:09.580
What if the Roar
really is a curse?
(WINCES)

896
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:12.000
(SHOUTS) Kion!

897
00:42:12.001 --> 00:42:14.750
(ROARS)
(SHOUTS) Whoa!

898
00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:18.170
Was that the Roar?
What's going on?

899
00:42:18.171 --> 00:42:19.960
The Roar just came out!

900
00:42:19.961 --> 00:42:23.330
I... I didn't mean to.
(GROANS)

901
00:42:23.331 --> 00:42:25.830
I believe you, Kion.
Me too.

902
00:42:25.831 --> 00:42:27.920
But we better
make sure Bunga's okay.

903
00:42:27.921 --> 00:42:30.460
Wait, what?
Kion Roared at Bunga?

904
00:42:30.461 --> 00:42:32.830
Ono, shh.
It was an accident!

905
00:42:32.831 --> 00:42:33.960
I'll find him.

906
00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:40.380
Got him!

907
00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:42.830
He looks dizzy. But he's fine.

908
00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.920
It's gonna be okay,
Kion.

909
00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:49.420
C'mon, let's go!

910
00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:58.330
Wow! That was
un-Bunga-lievable.

911
00:42:58.331 --> 00:43:01.080
Bunga! I'm so sorry.
I...

912
00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:03.120
I don't know
how that happened.

913
00:43:03.121 --> 00:43:05.710
<i> Hakuna Matata,</i> Kion.

914
00:43:05.711 --> 00:43:08.540
Just warn me
before you do it next time,

915
00:43:08.541 --> 00:43:09.830
so I can really enjoy it.

916
00:43:09.831 --> 00:43:11.380
Yeah.

917
00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:14.670
I think I'm going to need
Rafiki's help, too.

918
00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:19.170
RAFIKI: Hmm. Mm? Yes, yes.

919
00:43:19.171 --> 00:43:21.750
I'm afraid
you are correct, Ono.

920
00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:25.080
The vog has seriously
hurt your eyesight.

921
00:43:25.081 --> 00:43:27.540
Can't you just fix him
like you did last time?

922
00:43:27.541 --> 00:43:31.830
Hmm. Last time Ono
merely had dirt in his eye.

923
00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:34.500
This is more serious.

924
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.290
Only time will tell
if your vision will
return to full strength.

925
00:43:39.291 --> 00:43:41.080
Oh! (COUGHS)

926
00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:45.500
Don't be sad, Ono.
Everyone knows
you saved Bunga's life!

927
00:43:45.501 --> 00:43:48.120
That's right. You were
the keenest of sight

928
00:43:48.121 --> 00:43:50.540
when you saw Bunga
falling into the volcano.

929
00:43:50.541 --> 00:43:52.920
And you were the bravest
to dive after me!

930
00:43:52.921 --> 00:43:55.120
You were the fastest
to reach him in time.

931
00:43:55.121 --> 00:43:57.000
And the strongest
to pull him out.

932
00:43:57.001 --> 00:43:59.210
And fiercest
to never give up.

933
00:43:59.211 --> 00:44:02.710
(CHUCKLES WEAKLY)
I am the Lion Guard.

934
00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:06.000
Ono?

935
00:44:06.001 --> 00:44:09.540
<i>Shwari,</i> Makini.
Ono needs rest.

936
00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:14.880
Now, Kion.
About your eye...

937
00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:17.620
It's more than
just my eye.

938
00:44:17.621 --> 00:44:19.790
Ever since
Ushari bit me, I...

939
00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:21.880
I'm not feeling
quite right.

940
00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:27.540
Hmm. Yes... I have seen
this sort of injury before.

941
00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:29.920
And it is not good.

942
00:44:29.921 --> 00:44:31.880
Scar said
it's the Mark of Evil.

943
00:44:31.881 --> 00:44:33.960
He said it'll make
Kion turn bad.

944
00:44:33.961 --> 00:44:35.170
Honey badger! Hush!

945
00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:39.040
Your heart is racing, Kion.

946
00:44:39.041 --> 00:44:41.710
I'm surprised you are
able to stay so calm.

947
00:44:41.711 --> 00:44:43.620
It's not easy.

948
00:44:43.621 --> 00:44:45.920
I even Roared
at Bunga by accident.

949
00:44:45.921 --> 00:44:48.250
Makini, Tuliza plant.

950
00:44:48.251 --> 00:44:49.710
Yes, Rafiki. Of course.

951
00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:58.170
RAFIKI: Chew on the Tuliza
blossoms, Kion.

952
00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:04.170
Better?
Mm-hmm.

953
00:45:04.171 --> 00:45:06.920
The Tuliza will help
soothe your discomfort.

954
00:45:06.921 --> 00:45:08.710
But it is not a cure.

955
00:45:08.711 --> 00:45:11.120
Kion! Your face!

956
00:45:11.121 --> 00:45:13.920
Rafiki, will he be
all right?

957
00:45:13.921 --> 00:45:15.750
It's just
a scar, right?

958
00:45:15.751 --> 00:45:19.620
The venom from Ushari's bite
is still inside Kion.

959
00:45:19.621 --> 00:45:22.080
If the venom stays
inside him too long,

960
00:45:22.081 --> 00:45:25.750
he may no longer know
the difference between
right and wrong.

961
00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:28.250
Just like Scar.

962
00:45:28.251 --> 00:45:31.830
You can help him
get better. Right?

963
00:45:31.831 --> 00:45:35.330
There is no cure for Kion
here in the Pride Lands.

964
00:45:35.331 --> 00:45:36.460
What?
No!

965
00:45:36.461 --> 00:45:37.750
Rafiki?

966
00:45:37.751 --> 00:45:39.420
But there is still hope!

967
00:45:39.421 --> 00:45:44.460
If Kion is to get better,
he must seek out
the Tree of Life.

968
00:45:44.461 --> 00:45:46.620
Oh, yeah!
The Tree of Life!

969
00:45:46.621 --> 00:45:49.580
That's where animals
with nowhere else to go
go to seek help!

970
00:45:49.581 --> 00:45:51.330
Wait. You've been there?

971
00:45:51.331 --> 00:45:54.040
Yeah! But it's been
a while.

972
00:45:54.041 --> 00:45:57.960
Yes! The Tree of Life
is where I first met Makini.

973
00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:05.290
And the Lions of the Past
told me she would be
the next Royal Mjuzi.

974
00:46:05.291 --> 00:46:08.830
The Tree of Life is
a safe place for animals
who are hurt or sick.

975
00:46:08.831 --> 00:46:12.380
Or if only a few
of their kind are left.

976
00:46:12.381 --> 00:46:15.500
The Tree of Life
is very far away.

977
00:46:15.501 --> 00:46:17.330
And not easy to find.

978
00:46:17.331 --> 00:46:20.250
But there landmarks
to help guide your way.

979
00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:25.380
Hmm, yes. I see.

980
00:46:25.381 --> 00:46:28.290
(RAFIKI LAUGHS)
Yes, yes.

981
00:46:28.291 --> 00:46:32.880
Just follow
the paintings on the stones.

982
00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:36.170
It is only at the Tree of Life

983
00:46:36.171 --> 00:46:39.670
that Kion may find
the cure he needs.

984
00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:42.420
Then that's what I need to do.

985
00:46:42.421 --> 00:46:44.420
I need to go
to the Tree of Life.

986
00:46:44.421 --> 00:46:47.080
Maybe the Tree of Life
can help me, too.

987
00:46:47.081 --> 00:46:49.080
Oh, I'm sure it could!

988
00:46:49.081 --> 00:46:50.210
Then we'll all go with you.

989
00:46:50.211 --> 00:46:51.710
I don't think so.

990
00:46:51.711 --> 00:46:55.880
Why not? With Scar gone
and Jasiri in charge
of the Outlands,

991
00:46:55.881 --> 00:46:58.000
there's finally peace
in the Pride Lands.

992
00:46:58.001 --> 00:47:00.000
Mom? Dad?

993
00:47:00.001 --> 00:47:03.170
After everything
you've done for
the Pride Lands,

994
00:47:03.171 --> 00:47:05.620
I think it's okay
for the Lion Guard
to help you.

995
00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:10.000
I agree. Go Kion.
And have the Lion
Guard go with you.

996
00:47:10.001 --> 00:47:12.330
<i> Poa.</i>
Hey, wait.

997
00:47:12.331 --> 00:47:14.750
Ono's not the Keenest
of Sight anymore.

998
00:47:14.751 --> 00:47:17.920
Doesn't the Lion Guard
still need that?
Bunga!

999
00:47:17.921 --> 00:47:23.040
No, Bunga's right.
I'm not keenest of sight.
But I know who is.

1000
00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:26.500
Anga. You should
replace me on the Guard.

1001
00:47:26.501 --> 00:47:28.460
Me?
Indeed.

1002
00:47:28.461 --> 00:47:32.710
You can see nearly as well
as I did. And you can
fly even higher!

1003
00:47:32.711 --> 00:47:34.420
I can't replace you, Ono.

1004
00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:38.460
You're not just
the keenest of sight.
You're the smartest, too.

1005
00:47:38.461 --> 00:47:42.920
It's okay. You'll be great.
Common knowledge, really.

1006
00:47:42.921 --> 00:47:44.580
Ono's right, Anga.

1007
00:47:44.581 --> 00:47:46.250
The Lion Guard needs you.

1008
00:47:46.251 --> 00:47:48.420
Okay. I'm honored.

1009
00:47:49.210 --> 00:47:52.460
Anga. Now you are
the Keenest of Sight.

1010
00:47:57.790 --> 00:48:00.330
Oh. Guess that's it.

1011
00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:02.750
I'm not on the Guard anymore.

1012
00:48:03.830 --> 00:48:07.040
Not as the keenest of sight.
But Anga's right, too.

1013
00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:09.790
You're the smartest animal
I know.

1014
00:48:09.791 --> 00:48:13.500
And that's why I still
need you on the Lion Guard.

1015
00:48:13.501 --> 00:48:16.750
Ono, you are the Smartest.

1016
00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:22.540
(LAUGHS) Look at that!

1017
00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:25.330
Can he do that?

1018
00:48:25.331 --> 00:48:26.960
He just did.

1019
00:48:26.961 --> 00:48:29.040
Kion is leader
of the Lion Guard.

1020
00:48:29.041 --> 00:48:33.830
That's right. And now
the Lion Guard
has six members.

1021
00:48:33.831 --> 00:48:37.040
(LAUGHS) Never one
for tradition, is he?

1022
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:38.880
That's my boy.

1023
00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:42.960
SIMBA: Safe travels,
Lion Guard.

1024
00:48:42.961 --> 00:48:44.040
Thanks, Dad.

1025
00:48:44.041 --> 00:48:45.040
You know how
to get there?

1026
00:48:45.041 --> 00:48:47.000
Don't worry,
your majesty.

1027
00:48:47.001 --> 00:48:50.040
I've memorized the landmarks
that point the way
to the Tree of Life.

1028
00:48:50.041 --> 00:48:51.580
And I'll keep watch
from the sky.

1029
00:48:51.581 --> 00:48:53.710
But we should
probably get going.

1030
00:48:53.711 --> 00:48:58.000
Like my dad always says,
"The sooner you go,
the sooner you get there."

1031
00:48:58.001 --> 00:49:00.540
That's right.
So let's go already!

1032
00:49:00.541 --> 00:49:03.120
Bring Kion home safe.

1033
00:49:03.121 --> 00:49:05.620
Of course, Your Majesty.

1034
00:49:05.621 --> 00:49:07.170
MAKINI: Wait for me!

1035
00:49:07.171 --> 00:49:08.580
Makini?

1036
00:49:08.581 --> 00:49:11.460
I have agreed
to let Makini go with you.

1037
00:49:11.461 --> 00:49:14.170
I've already been
to the Tree of Life,
remember?

1038
00:49:14.171 --> 00:49:15.670
When I was little!

1039
00:49:15.671 --> 00:49:18.620
<i> Poa!</i> I'm sure we could use
the help. Right, Ono?

1040
00:49:18.621 --> 00:49:20.500
Uh... I guess?

1041
00:49:20.501 --> 00:49:23.210
And I can give you Tuliza
whenever you need it.

1042
00:49:23.211 --> 00:49:25.420
Oh! That'd be great, Makini.

1043
00:49:25.421 --> 00:49:28.170
Good luck, Kion.
Thanks, Kiara.

1044
00:49:28.171 --> 00:49:31.170
Keep Tiifu and Zuri
out of trouble
while we're gone.

1045
00:49:31.171 --> 00:49:32.750
I will.

1046
00:49:32.751 --> 00:49:35.710
Hopefully, you'll be
back in time for
Kiara's first hunt.

1047
00:49:35.711 --> 00:49:36.920
I hope so.

1048
00:49:36.921 --> 00:49:38.210
We'll miss you, son.

1049
00:49:40.170 --> 00:49:41.880
Everyone ready?

1050
00:49:41.881 --> 00:49:46.170
(LAUGHS) It seems
