It must really like
that snake skin.

40
00:02:40.421 --> 00:02:44.501
No, no, no. It's using the
scent from the snake skin
to mask its own smell.

41
00:02:44.501 --> 00:02:45.669
That way snakes
won't detect him.

we crocodiles listen
to a hippo?

So you say.

109
00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.290
But I think you
listen to the hippos
because you're weak.

110
00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:03.580
You're afraid
of them!

111

Don't forget, Kion.

Let's go.

291
00:14:14.209 --> 00:14:16.789
But why?

292
00:14:16.831 --> 00:14:20.041
If I start using
the Roar when I'm angry,
I'll be as bad as Scar.

293
00:14:20.041 --> 00:14:23.251
Besides, the Roar
might destroy whatever fish
are left in the lake.

294
00:14:23.251 --> 00:14:27.620
There's gotta be another
way to get the crocs to
leave Big Springs.

295
00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:29.330
That's right, Kion.

296
00:14:29.371 --> 00:14:35.121
Go! The new leader
of the crocodiles
takes orders from nobody!

297
00:14:35.919 --> 00:14:38.789
Wait! I've got an idea...

298
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:41.080
I don't see
how I can help.

299
00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.500
I was thinking.

300
00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:44.710
If you called
for another <i>mashindano,</i>

301
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:46.540
you might be able
to beat Makuu.

302
00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:48.079
Then you could lead
the crocodiles again!

303
00:14:48.079 --> 00:14:52.289
(SCOFFS) You were there, Kion.

304
00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:54.330
Makuu is
stronger than me.

305
00:14:54.371 --> 00:14:58.371
There are times
when you have to accept
that you've been beaten.

306
00:14:58.371 --> 00:15:00.420
Even though
you might not like it,

307
00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:02.669
Makuu has most
certainly won!

308
00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:06.620
But that doesn't make him
a better leader than you!

309
00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:08.670
True. But he's young.

310
00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:09.250
He can learn.

311
00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:11.540
Take my advice.

312
00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:14.459
If you really want to avoid
a fight with Makuu,

313
00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:17.580
the best thing to do
is just back down.

314
00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:22.380
You're not really

are you, Kion?

(SNIFFS) Okay.

346
00:16:36.499 --> 00:16:38.419
Mmm, spicy!

347
00:16:38.419 --> 00:16:40.669
Ooh, my tongue is tingly!

348
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:41.670
(BURPS)

349
00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:44.170
Excuse me!
(CHUCKLES)

350
00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:44.960
Yes! It worked!

351
00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:48.080
Bunga, you are stink free!

352
00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.169
Mmm! How 'bout that?
(CHUCKLES)

353
00:16:50.169 --> 00:16:51.829
Bunga's minty fresh!

354
00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:53.920
Oh, that's great.

355
00:16:53.961 --> 00:16:56.251
Uh, but don't you guys
have bigger things
to worry about?

356
00:16:56.251 --> 00:16:58.080
Like, oh, I dunno...

357
00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.710
Baboons overrunning
Pride Rock?

358
00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:02.249
Good point, Kiara!

359
00:17:02.249 --> 00:17:03.209
What are we going to do
about that, Kion?

360
00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.290
I...

361
00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:07.500
I don't know yet.

362
00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.380
You guys head
back to the Lair.

363
00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:10.880
I need some
time to think.

364
00:17:12.209 --> 00:17:14.169
He better come
up with something.

365
00:17:14.169 --> 00:17:16.829
(GRUNTS) You're telling me!

366
00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:18.210
Oh... Baboons.

367
00:17:23.669 --> 00:17:25.289
Grandfather,

368
00:17:25.289 --> 00:17:26.959
I don't know if
you can hear me.

369
00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.420
But, I'm not sure
what to do.

370
00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:37.170
<i>I'm always here
for you, Kion.</i>

371
00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:40.329
The new crocodile
leader, Makuu,

372
00:17:40.371 --> 00:17:43.501
he's messed things up
for animals all over
the Pride Lands.

373
00:17:43.501 --> 00:17:45.500
And all he wants
to do is fight!

374
00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:48.290
<i>Fighting is the
crocodile way.</i>

375
00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:49.919
I think Makuu's a bully.

376
00:17:49.919 --> 00:17:53.579
But Pua,
the old crocodile leader,

377
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.790
says I should
just back down.

378
00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:59.460
<i>There are times
to back down, Kion.</i>

379
00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:03.790
<i>But a true leader has to
know when to stand his ground,</i>

380
00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:06.830
<i>even if it
seems difficult.</i>

381
00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:09.500
But fighting can't be
the solution to every problem!

382
00:18:09.541 --> 00:18:13.621
(CHUCKLES) <i>Standing your
ground doesn't mean
you have to fight.</i>

383
00:18:13.621 --> 00:18:17.499
<i>It means you're not
afraid to stand up to someone</i>

384
00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:18.920
<i>who you know is wrong,</i>

385
00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:23.920
<i>and show them you're not
going to back down.</i>

386
00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:26.499
Oh. I think I understand.

387
00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:33.290
So, I've given it
a lot of thought.

388
00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:35.170
If Makuu wants a fight,

389
00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:37.749
he needs to know
the Lion Guard can bring it.

390
00:18:37.749 --> 00:18:39.959
Yeah! Now we're talking!

391
00:18:40.001 --> 00:18:42.831
Personally, I wish there
was a way we could
avoid the fight.

392
00:18:42.831 --> 00:18:44.920
I hope we still can, Ono.

393
00:18:44.961 --> 00:18:49.711
I think a demonstration of
the Roar will show Makuu
exactly what he's up against,

394
00:18:49.711 --> 00:18:51.459
without hurting anyone.

395
00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:53.380
Can we do that?

396
00:18:53.421 --> 00:18:58.371
Maybe you can use the Roar
on the grove of trees
near the Spring.

397
00:18:58.371 --> 00:19:00.580
Far as I know,
nobody lives there.

398
00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:01.879
And I know just
about everybody!

399
00:19:01.879 --> 00:19:05.329
Perfect! Bunga,
Fuli, Ono,

400
00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:07.620
go make sure the grove
is clear of animals.

401
00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:09.920
'Cause nobody's
where they usually are today.

402
00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.290
Beshte, you're with me!

403
00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:15.209
Till the Pride Lands' end...

404
00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:17.250
ALL: Lion Guard defend!

405
00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:18.920
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

406
00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:23.580
Looks clear to me.

407
00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.329
Ono? See anything?

408
00:19:25.329 --> 00:19:28.459
Nope. I think we're good
to give Kion the high sign...

409
00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:29.290
Wait!

410
00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:32.750
No, no, no! Not again!

411
00:19:34.501 --> 00:19:38.291
Makuu, you and your crocs
need to leave Big Springs now.

412
00:19:38.291 --> 00:19:39.749
Or the Lion Guard
will force you out.

413
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:43.330
Tough talk, Kion.

414
00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:46.330
Can you back it up
with action?

415
00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:48.540
You better believe it.

416
00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:51.459
ONO: Hapana!
Kion's about to
use the roar!

417
00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.790
Little hyrax, you need
to leave this tree.

418
00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:56.380
Something quite dangerous
will be occurring soon!

419
00:19:58.371 --> 00:20:01.541
If I could climb trees,
I know I could get that
hyrax to move.

420
00:20:01.541 --> 00:20:04.289
Wait! I know how
to scare him off!

421
00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:09.920
Hey Hyraxie! Remember me

422
00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.710
and my stink?

Oh, no! What have I done?

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:25.379
Guys, we gotta get going!

428
00:20:25.379 --> 00:20:27.499
I know!
But my stink isn't
scaring him away!

429
00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:28.750
You think
I should eat him?

430
00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:31.170
BOTH: No!

431
00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:33.750
Bunga! Just grab the hyrax
and bring it down here.

All clear, Kion.

437
00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:47.210
Okay, Makuu.

438
00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:49.830
If you want a fight,
the Lion Guard can bring it.

439
00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:52.499
Just be careful
what you ask for.

440
00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:53.790
Oh? And why is that?

441
00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:56.290
Because of this.

Yep. Except for one thing...

449
00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:38.670
Makuu! Once the fish
population is built back up,

450
00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:41.169
you and the crocs
are welcome to come back.

451
00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:43.620
All you have to do is ask.

452
00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:46.380
I'll keep that in mind.

453
00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:49.580
Sorry about changing
your smell, Bunga.

its uses!
