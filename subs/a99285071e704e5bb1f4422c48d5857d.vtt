KION: The fiercest, bravest,

fastest, strongest
and keenest of sight.

8
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.500
<i>Poa...</i> There sure are lots
of paintings about the old
Lion Guards avengers.

9
00:01:18.501 --> 00:01:19.750
Yeah.

10
00:01:19.751 --> 00:01:22.580
But nothing about them
battling an evil lion

11
00:01:22.581 --> 00:01:24.330
who's come back
from the past.

12
00:01:24.331 --> 00:01:26.290
Maybe its never
happened before.

13
00:01:26.291 --> 00:01:29.250
Or maybe you just haven't
seen the right painting yet.

14
00:01:29.251 --> 00:01:32.500
Did you know that all
the lair's caverns
have paintings in them?

15
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.330
Really?
Oh, yes.

16
00:01:34.331 --> 00:01:37.330
And there are so many caverns,
you wouldn't believe it.

17
00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:38.620
Come on, I'll show you!

18
00:01:38.621 --> 00:01:41.080
Rafiki has been teaching
me all about them.

19
00:01:41.081 --> 00:01:43.080

(SIGHS) So much for

60
00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:50.420
Yep. I say we go show
Scar what's what.

61
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.420
Hmm.
You coming?

62
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.420
What is it, Kion?

63
00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.580
I'm not sure.

64
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.670
This painting kinda looks
like the mark of evil.

65
00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.420
You mean that symbol
Scar burned in the dirt?

66
00:04:03.421 --> 00:04:04.460
Yes.

67
00:04:04.461 --> 00:04:05.920
That's what Rafiki called it.

68
00:04:05.921 --> 00:04:07.750
This painting
must be important.

69
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.670
So important they didn't
even bother to finish it?

70
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.620
Maybe they stopped painting
because they couldn't paint
anymore.

71
00:04:13.621 --> 00:04:15.250
Look! There's no more room.

72
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.920
Or maybe the painting
came first.

73
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.500
Before the rock.

74
00:04:20.501 --> 00:04:23.080
Beshte, think you
can move this rock?

75
00:04:23.081 --> 00:04:24.250
You got it, Kion.

76
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.500
<i>Twende Kibo...</i> (GRUNTS)

77
00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:31.080
<i>...ko?
</i> Whew!

78
00:04:31.081 --> 00:04:32.880
It's really wedged in there.

79
00:04:32.881 --> 00:04:34.670
But I'll get it. (GRUNTS)

80
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.000
(GRUNTING)

81
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.830
Look at that.
Wow!

82
00:04:43.831 --> 00:04:46.460
A secret cave!
(LAUGHS)

83
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.170
That's the mark of
evil, all right.

84
00:04:49.171 --> 00:04:50.790
And the original Lion Guard.

85
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:52.620
You were right, Kion!

86
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.290
I think this means the cave
leads to a secret chamber

87
00:05:03.291 --> 00:05:04.330
deep beneath the lair.

88
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.330
Makini, what does that mean?

89
00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:15.830
Well...

90
00:05:15.831 --> 00:05:17.670
It looks like
a long time ago

91
00:05:17.671 --> 00:05:20.580
the lions of the Pride Lands
found a way to defeat

92
00:05:20.581 --> 00:05:22.250
a great evil,

93
00:05:22.251 --> 00:05:23.920
and this chamber
holds the secret.

94
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.500
Then we're going
to that chamber.

95
00:05:26.501 --> 00:05:27.580
Now we're talking!

96
00:05:27.581 --> 00:05:29.210
<i>Zuka...</i>
MAKINI: Wait!

97
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.420
This painting's a warning.

98
00:05:34.421 --> 00:05:36.250
The caves are dangerous.

99
00:05:36.251 --> 00:05:38.580
Well, they are caves.

100
00:05:38.581 --> 00:05:40.500
And if there is a powerful
secret down there

101
00:05:40.501 --> 00:05:43.500
the lions of the past would
have wanted it away from
prying eyes.

102
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.330
It may be dangerous,

103
00:05:45.331 --> 00:05:48.750
but we're the Pride Lands
fiercest, bravest, fastest,
strongest

104
00:05:48.751 --> 00:05:50.540
and keenest of sight.

105
00:05:50.541 --> 00:05:54.170
If anyone's gonna find
the secret to defeating
evil, it's us.

106
00:05:54.171 --> 00:05:55.540
You said it, Kion.

107
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.540
Like I was saying,

108
00:05:57.541 --> 00:05:59.040
<i>Zuka Zama!</i>

109
00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.880
Sorry, Makini, but you'll be
safer if you stay here.

110
00:06:03.881 --> 00:06:07.420
That's okay, I've got all
these amazing new paintings
to look at.

111
00:06:07.421 --> 00:06:09.540
Or if they're not new
they're old, but,

112
00:06:09.541 --> 00:06:12.420
the're new to me
and they're all amazing!

113
00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.920
Look! Another painting.

114
00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.920
Too bad we don't have Makini
here to make it move and tell
us what it means.

115
00:06:23.921 --> 00:06:26.580
Don't worry.
I can figure it out.

116
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.540
Mmm-hmm.

117
00:06:29.541 --> 00:06:30.960
Uh-huh.

118
00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:32.620
Mmm.

119
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:33.880
Well?

120
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:35.880
Nope. I got nothing.

121
00:06:35.881 --> 00:06:37.080
Want me to go get Makini?

122
00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:40.920
Mmm-mmm. I'm still worried
it might be too dangerous
down here.

123
00:06:40.921 --> 00:06:42.920
Yeah. Who knows what
could happen to her?

124
00:06:42.921 --> 00:06:44.170
(RUMBLING)

125
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.500
Whoa!
Beshte!

126
00:06:46.501 --> 00:06:47.500

<i>Hapana!

Sharp rocks coming up!

131
00:07:00.421 --> 00:07:02.500
I mean, you're coming down
on sharp rocks!

132
00:07:02.501 --> 00:07:03.500

139
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.620
Everybody okay?
Yep. I'm okay.

140
00:07:18.621 --> 00:07:19.790
Thanks, Beshte.

141
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.120
Oh, good thing we had
the Pride Lands strongest
with us.

142
00:07:23.121 --> 00:07:24.620
You said it, Ono.

143
00:07:24.621 --> 00:07:26.290
Okay...

144
00:07:26.291 --> 00:07:27.670
Ono can fly, but

145
00:07:27.671 --> 00:07:29.540
how do the rest of us
get back up there?

146
00:07:29.541 --> 00:07:32.540
Maybe we're not
supposed to. Look!

147
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.290
You think we should
go in there?

148
00:07:36.291 --> 00:07:39.120
The painting said the chamber
was deep beneath the lair.

149
00:07:39.121 --> 00:07:40.670
(SCOFFS) We're deep,
all right.

150
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.380
(GASPS) Another painting.

151
00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.500
Any idea what it means?

152
00:07:54.501 --> 00:07:57.540
I think it means we're on
the right path. Come on!

153
00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:02.380
(SIGHS) I hope we're getting
closer to this big secret.

154
00:08:02.381 --> 00:08:03.670
We gotta be.

155
00:08:03.671 --> 00:08:05.330
We're still finding paintings.

156
00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:08.580
So, which way now?

157
00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:11.380
Huh?

158
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:15.170
I got this. I've got loads
of experience with caves.

159
00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:19.000
Who knows, maybe he
picked the right one.

160
00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:22.670
Or maybe not.

161
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.670
Dead end. Let's head back.

162
00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:29.540
Or, maybe it just looks
like a dead end.

163
00:08:29.541 --> 00:08:31.710
(GRUNTING)

164
00:08:31.711 --> 00:08:33.830
I bet it's another
secret passage.

165
00:08:33.831 --> 00:08:36.170
(GRUNTS) Like before!

166
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:38.750
It's just a wall, Bunga.

167
00:08:38.751 --> 00:08:40.750
I don't think so.

168
00:08:40.751 --> 00:08:42.920
(SCREAMING AND GRUNTS)

169
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:47.710
Okay... It could be a wall.

170
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:53.210
MAKINI: Then Askari and his
Lion Guard led the animals
to Mizimu Grove.

171
00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:00.880
Oh. I'm kinda far away
from the entrance.

172
00:09:00.881 --> 00:09:01.880
I better go back.

173
00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.210
The first painting said
this cavern's dangerous.

174
00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:09.540
Except, all these paintings
must have been painted by
a Royal Mjuzi.

175
00:09:09.541 --> 00:09:12.040
And I'm a Royal Mjuzi
in training.

176
00:09:12.041 --> 00:09:14.210
So it should be safe enough
for me to look at

177
00:09:14.211 --> 00:09:16.460
just one more painting,
or two.

178
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:30.620
Ugh. Another dead end.

179
00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.750
Nah. This one's definitely
a secret passage.

182
00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:42.080
Why does that keep happening?

183
00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:44.670
Because this path is
nothing but dead ends.

184
00:09:44.671 --> 00:09:46.830
It doesn't make sense.

185
00:09:46.831 --> 00:09:50.460
Why would the paintings
lead us down here if there's
no way to get through?

186
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:55.670
Ono, fly up there and see
if you can get the lay of
the land.

187
00:09:55.671 --> 00:09:57.000
Affirmative.

188
00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:05.210
Oh...

189
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:08.290
I know why we keep
hitting dead ends.

190
00:10:08.291 --> 00:10:09.830
We're in a maze!

191
00:10:09.831 --> 00:10:12.460
And it looks just like that
last painting we saw.

192
00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:14.710
Don't worry.
I'll find the way out.

193
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:18.790
Hmm.

194
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:20.790
Got it.

195
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.790
Follow me. This way!

197
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.330
Oh.

198
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.330
Oh!

199
00:10:33.331 --> 00:10:36.620
What wonderful wisdom do you
have for me, new painting?

200
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:40.120
(GASPS)

201
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:48.750
(GASPS) It's a warning.

202
00:10:48.751 --> 00:10:52.250
Oh, no. Kion! Fuli!

203
00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:55.830
Bunga, Ono, Beshte.
Are you okay?

204
00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:58.830
Good work, Ono.

205
00:10:58.831 --> 00:11:00.750
You got us through.
Happy to help.

206
00:11:00.751 --> 00:11:03.830
I still think I could have
found the secret passageway.

207
00:11:03.831 --> 00:11:07.540
(LAUGHS) Luckily, we had
the keenest of sight with
us so you didn't have to.

208
00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:11.540
Yeah. Just like it was lucky
we had Beshte with us earlier

209
00:11:11.541 --> 00:11:13.880
or we might have been
smashed on those rocks.

210
00:11:13.881 --> 00:11:15.210
Oh, it was nothing.

211
00:11:15.211 --> 00:11:18.250
Wait. What if it's
not luck at all?

212
00:11:18.251 --> 00:11:19.830
What if this is all a test?

213
00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:22.880
We needed the strongest
and the keenest of sight

214
00:11:22.881 --> 00:11:25.170
to get past those
first two obstacles.

215
00:11:25.171 --> 00:11:27.380
All these hidden caves
and challenges,

216
00:11:27.381 --> 00:11:29.880
it's meant to see if
we're a worthy Lion Guard.

217
00:11:29.881 --> 00:11:32.580
Worthy? Of course,
we're worthy!

218
00:11:32.581 --> 00:11:33.880
Worthy of what?

219
00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:36.620
Worthy of discovering
the secret

220
00:11:36.621 --> 00:11:38.380
to defeating great evil.

221
00:11:38.381 --> 00:11:40.880
Yeah. The lions of the past
must have made it

222
00:11:40.881 --> 00:11:43.960
so that only the best of
the best can make it
down here.

223
00:11:43.961 --> 00:11:45.580
That's us!

224
00:11:45.581 --> 00:11:48.040
I mean, who else in
the Pride Lands could
have gotten this far?

225
00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:49.880
Seriously, who else?

226
00:11:49.881 --> 00:11:52.750
There you are! I'm
so glad you're okay.

227
00:11:52.751 --> 00:11:54.540
ALL: Makini!
Oh, hey, Makini.

228
00:11:54.541 --> 00:11:57.880
I was just saying that nobody
else in the Pride Lands could
get down...

229
00:11:57.881 --> 00:11:59.750
Hey!
How did you make it
through the maze?

230
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:03.210
Oh, that? I just
followed your footsteps.

231
00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:05.210
Oh, good thinking.

232
00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:09.120
Follow our footsteps!

233
00:12:09.121 --> 00:12:11.750
Why didn't we follow
our footsteps?

234
00:12:11.751 --> 00:12:13.580
Because we hadn't
made them yet?

235
00:12:13.581 --> 00:12:15.460
Ah, good point.

236
00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:19.750
Makini? I'm not sure
it's a good idea for you
to be down here.

237
00:12:19.751 --> 00:12:21.830
But, Kion, all these
paintings down here

238
00:12:21.831 --> 00:12:24.620
must have been painted
by a Royal Mjuzi, like me.

239
00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.080
She's right.

240
00:12:26.081 --> 00:12:28.330
Okay, then just stay close.

241
00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:29.830
Mmm-hmm.

242
00:12:29.831 --> 00:12:31.460
Now that we know
these are tests,

243
00:12:31.461 --> 00:12:33.750
we know it's not
gonna get any easier.

244
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:36.080
Up here, this way.

245
00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.500
Whoa, stop!

246
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.670
There's the path,
over there!

247
00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:49.580
But how do we get to it?
There's no way across.

248
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:52.960
Is this another test?

249
00:12:52.961 --> 00:12:54.290
I can get across.

250
00:12:54.291 --> 00:12:55.880
You've already
had your test.

251
00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:00.960
Unless this is a test
for the keenest of flight.

252
00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:04.670
Earlier Lion Guards
were all lions.
They couldn't fly.

253
00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:08.290
Oh, yeah. Too bad.
Ono would've aced this test.

254
00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.540
Hey, guys, over here!

255
00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.040
It's a lion on the edge
of the cliff, just like now.

256
00:13:14.041 --> 00:13:16.330
Hey, that's the bravest lion.

257
00:13:16.331 --> 00:13:18.620
That's me!
I'm the bravest lion.

258
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.500
Except the lion part.

259
00:13:21.501 --> 00:13:23.330
So make it move.
Let's see what I do.

260
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.380
That was a lot of help.

261
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:33.420
He just walked out
into empty air.

262
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:34.920
I could do that.

263
00:13:34.921 --> 00:13:37.880
Hang on, Bunga.
Let's think about this.

264
00:13:37.881 --> 00:13:39.670
Think about it? Pfft!

265
00:13:39.671 --> 00:13:41.000
Since when do I do that?

There's a bridge.

273
00:13:58.250 --> 00:13:59.500
There is?

Well, it's always been there.
We just couldn't see it.

278
00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:11.250
It's called
an optical illusion.

279
00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:15.210
Aw... I thought maybe
I was the keenest of flight.

280
00:14:15.211 --> 00:14:18.880
I've never seen anything
like an invisible bridge
before.

281
00:14:18.881 --> 00:14:22.120
I can't wait to get back
and tell Rafiki all about it.

282
00:14:22.121 --> 00:14:24.120
Better yet, I'll paint it!

283
00:14:24.121 --> 00:14:28.210
And exactly how
are you going to paint
an invisible bridge?

284
00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.960
Oh, good question, Fuli.

285
00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:42.380
Oh, we're really close
to the final chamber.

286
00:14:42.381 --> 00:14:44.250
The entrance is at
the end of this path.

287
00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:47.380
You mean the entrance
that's blocked
by a gigantic rock?

288
00:14:47.381 --> 00:14:49.540
This must be another test.

289
00:14:49.541 --> 00:14:51.120
I don't know, Kion.

290
00:14:51.121 --> 00:14:53.880
I don't think even Beshte
can move a rock this big.

291
00:14:53.881 --> 00:14:55.920
Maybe not. But I can try.

292
00:14:55.921 --> 00:14:58.620
Wait, I've already
had my test.

293

00:17:39.211 --> 00:17:40.380
It's called an echo.

353
00:17:40.381 --> 00:17:43.920
KION: Right, and I'm gonna
use it to lead us all
out of here.

354
00:17:43.921 --> 00:17:45.500
(KION ROARS)

355
00:17:45.501 --> 00:17:47.420
(ROAR ECHOING)

356
00:17:47.421 --> 00:17:49.290
Okay, there's a wall
to our left.

357
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:51.830
(ROARS)

358
00:17:51.831 --> 00:17:53.290
(ROAR ECHOING)

359
00:17:53.291 --> 00:17:55.420
Okay, and one dead ahead.

360
00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.250
(KION ROARS)

361
00:17:57.251 --> 00:17:59.460
(ROAR ECHOING)

362
00:17:59.461 --> 00:18:01.830
Okay, we're going this way.

363
00:18:01.831 --> 00:18:03.460
Everyone stay close.

364
00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:10.330
(KION ROARS)

365
00:18:10.331 --> 00:18:12.170
(ROAR ECHOING)

366
00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:21.250
Nice job, Kion.

367
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:24.750
If that was
a test of leadership,
I'd say you passed.

368
00:18:24.751 --> 00:18:26.210
Indeed.

369
00:18:26.211 --> 00:18:28.120
Wow, look at this place.

370
00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:31.290
Guys? I think we made it.

371
00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.330
<i>Poa.</i>

372
00:18:34.331 --> 00:18:35.380
Fascinating.

373
00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:42.000
I never dreamed
it'd be so beautiful.

374
00:18:42.001 --> 00:18:45.330
Look at this painting.
And this one!

375
00:18:45.331 --> 00:18:47.290
Like my dad always says,

376
00:18:47.291 --> 00:18:49.290
"Live long enough,
and you'll see everything."

377
00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:52.120
I don't think he ever thought
I'd see something like this.

378
00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:55.120
Yeah, but where's the secret?

379
00:18:55.121 --> 00:18:57.790
(CHUCKLES)
We've come this far.

380
00:18:57.791 --> 00:18:59.460
I think we'll find it, Bunga.

381
00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:02.000
Good, after all these tests,

382
00:19:02.001 --> 00:19:04.210
I'm itching
to fight great evil.

383
00:19:04.211 --> 00:19:05.670
(EXCLAIMS)

384
00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:08.670
Or maybe I'm just itchy.

385
00:19:08.671 --> 00:19:10.500
MAKINI: Everyone, over here!

386
00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:14.170
I think the story
we're looking for
is right here, look.

387
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:19.000
It all started long ago.

388
00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:22.420
A very evil group of lions

389
00:19:22.421 --> 00:19:24.830
tried to take over
the Pride Lands.

390
00:19:24.831 --> 00:19:27.920
And, in doing so,
they nearly destroyed it.

391
00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:31.250
So, the good lions
of the Pride Lands

392
00:19:31.251 --> 00:19:33.830
created a powerful,
unstoppable force

393
00:19:33.831 --> 00:19:37.000
that could defeat
the evil lions,
once and for all.

394
00:19:37.001 --> 00:19:38.170
And it worked!

395
00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:42.080
But only the worthiest
in the Pride Lands

396
00:19:42.081 --> 00:19:45.040
would be allowed
to find this force
and use it.

397
00:19:45.041 --> 00:19:47.500
That's us,
we're the worthiest.

398
00:19:47.501 --> 00:19:50.250
But where is this
unstoppable force?

399
00:19:50.251 --> 00:19:51.210
What's the secret?

400
00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:53.790
I think...

401
00:19:53.791 --> 00:19:55.790
It's right...

402
00:19:55.791 --> 00:19:57.880
Over there.

403
00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:01.880
Okay, guys,
we've come all this way.

404
00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:09.120
Everyone ready?

405
00:20:09.121 --> 00:20:12.460
You kidding?
Cave of secrets,
here we come.

406
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:18.040
Makini, will you
do the honors?

407
00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.040
(BREATHING DEEPLY) Okay.

408
00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:35.080
ALL: Huh?

409
00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:40.750
That's... Unexpected.

410
00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.960
There's gotta be
more than this.

411
00:20:42.961 --> 00:20:46.420
I know, maybe the
secret's in the water.

412
00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:49.750
Bunga!

413
00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:53.290
Nope, no secret
to defeating great
evil in there.

414
00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.920
<i>Heyvi kabisa!</i>

415
00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:59.420
Actually, I think
there is, look.

416
00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:04.460
The great force to defeating
great evil is here.

417
00:21:04.461 --> 00:21:06.420
It's us.

418
00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:08.330
<i>Poa.</i>

419
00:21:08.331 --> 00:21:09.330
Oh...

420
00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:10.830
We're the secret.

421
00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:14.540
Well, yeah, that's what
I've been saying all along!

422
00:21:14.541 --> 00:21:15.790
Of course!

423
00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:18.540
It's all right here
in the paintings.

424
00:21:18.541 --> 00:21:21.670
That's the secret
they created
to defeat great evil.

425
00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:25.290
Askari's original Lion Guard.

426
00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:28.790
Exactly.

427
00:21:28.791 --> 00:21:31.330
If I had figured that out
from all the paintings
earlier,

428
00:21:31.331 --> 00:21:33.500
you wouldn't have had
to go through all those
dangerous tests.

429
00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:35.330
Sorry.

430
00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.500
Actually, Makini,

431
00:21:37.501 --> 00:21:40.540
I think we had to go
through those tests.

432
00:21:40.541 --> 00:21:42.790
So everyone would know
we were worthy?

433
00:21:42.791 --> 00:21:44.330
So we'd know.

434
00:21:44.331 --> 00:21:47.830
We are the powerful,
unstoppable force

435
00:21:47.831 --> 00:21:51.120
that will defeat Scar,
together.

436
00:21:51.121 --> 00:21:53.330
Because we're the Lion Guard.

437
00:21:53.331 --> 00:21:54.710
Right.

438
00:21:54.711 --> 00:21:56.380
Till the Pride Lands end...

439
00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:58.880
ALL: Lion Guard Defend!

440
00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:03.330
(CHORUS VOCALIZING)

441
00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:28.420
<i>♪ Look out,
Here comes the Lion Guard ♪</i>
