he even smashed a fox den.

Like my dad always says,

352
00:16:27.121 --> 00:16:29.790
"You can't go wrong
trying to make things right."

354
00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:34.420
And here's my chance.

355
00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:36.380
Thanks, little guy.

356
00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:38.960
Hey there, little fox.

357
00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:40.750
I just wanted
to say sorry about...

358
00:16:40.751 --> 00:16:42.540
Poa the Destroyer.

359
00:16:42.541 --> 00:16:43.620
No! (STAMMERS) Wait.

360
00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.170

(SIGHS)

362
00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.580
Guys, think you can
waddle a little faster?

363
00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:55.790
You do know what
waddling means, don't you?

364
00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.790
Uh, yeah, sure,
Besides,

365
00:16:58.791 --> 00:17:00.000
what's the rush,
Baliyo?

366
00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:03.000
You still haven't told us
why Rani wants to see us.

367
00:17:03.001 --> 00:17:06.040
I know, but Rani
didn't want me
to tell you because...

368
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.080
Uh...
Is it a surprise party?

369
00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:10.880
For me?

370
00:17:10.881 --> 00:17:11.960
No, Pinguino, it's...

371
00:17:11.961 --> 00:17:14.000
Oh, how I love parties.

372
00:17:14.001 --> 00:17:16.750
I hope Rani remembers
how much I love sardines.

373
00:17:16.751 --> 00:17:17.830
Don't worry, Baliyo.

374
00:17:17.831 --> 00:17:20.580
I'll act all surprised.
And a party's just what
I need after...

375
00:17:20.581 --> 00:17:23.000
Pinguino.
It's not a party.

376
00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:24.170
Then what is it?

377
00:17:24.171 --> 00:17:25.790
Hey, Baliyo.
Hurry it up.

378
00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:28.080
We don't want to keep Rani
and Beshte waiting.

379
00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:30.210
Beshte? What's a Beshte?

380
00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:33.830
Oh, right.
You guys call him <i>Poa.</i>

381
00:17:33.831 --> 00:17:35.040
The Destroyer.

382
00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:36.540
ALL: Poa?

383
00:17:36.541 --> 00:17:38.000
The Destroyer?

384
00:17:38.001 --> 00:17:39.620
Oh, yeah, that's him.

385
00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.000
We're gatherin' everyone up
in one place.

386
00:17:42.001 --> 00:17:44.040
So we can really
let you know what he's like.

387
00:17:44.041 --> 00:17:46.830
Oh, no, no, no, no.
He'll never get me.

388
00:17:46.831 --> 00:17:49.290
Pinguino? Where you going?

389
00:17:49.291 --> 00:17:50.880
Yeah, come on back.

390
00:17:50.881 --> 00:17:52.080
Forget it.

391
00:17:52.081 --> 00:17:54.380
You won't catch me anywhere
near that bad guy.

392
00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.120
Was it something I said?

393
00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.750
Phew, almost home.

394
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:04.960

No, no. My name's Beshte,

00:18:09.501 --> 00:18:12.040
You can't fool me
by changing your name.

00:18:12.041 --> 00:18:14.420
I know you're <i>Poa</i>

399
00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:16.000
I'm not a destroyer.

400
00:18:16.001 --> 00:18:18.250
And I'm really sorry
I messed up your slide.

401
00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:19.830
Stay away from me, <i>Poa.</i>

402
00:18:19.831 --> 00:18:21.330
Wait. Don't be scared.

403
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:23.210
Stop chasing me, <i>Poa.</i>

404
00:18:23.211 --> 00:18:26.960
I'm not chasing you.
And my name is Beshte.

405
00:18:26.961 --> 00:18:29.880
Ha. I won't let you
destroy me, <i>Poa.</i>

406

BESHTE: Hey, little guy.

407
00:18:32.121 --> 00:18:33.960
I wouldn't go that way
if I were you.

408
00:18:33.961 --> 00:18:35.290
It looks dangerous.

409
00:18:35.291 --> 00:18:38.880
Don't tell me what to do, <i>Poa</i>
Leave me alone.

410
00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:42.080
He could get into
real trouble up there.

(GRUNTS)

412
00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:48.920
Ha, lost him.

00:18:48.921 --> 00:18:51.380
Don't tell me I'm not
a fast waddler.

419
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.830
(STAMMERS) What happened?

420
00:19:07.831 --> 00:19:09.000
You okay?

421
00:19:09.001 --> 00:19:10.960
Poa? You saved me?

422
00:19:10.961 --> 00:19:12.620
Well, yeah.
But my name is...

423
00:19:12.621 --> 00:19:16.620
Poa. Thank you.
Thank you so much, Poa.

424
00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.040
You're welcome.

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:20.170
Thank you all for coming.

00:19:20.171 --> 00:19:21.420
Of course, Rani.

427
00:19:21.421 --> 00:19:22.540
What's going on?

428
00:19:22.541 --> 00:19:24.920
It seems there's been a

429
00:19:24.921 --> 00:19:27.540
misunderstanding
with one of our new guests.

430
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:30.290
Yes. You might know him
as Poa...

ALL: The Destroyer.

432
00:19:32.211 --> 00:19:34.420
But his name's
not really <i>Poa.</i>

433
00:19:34.421 --> 00:19:35.750
It's Beshte.

434
00:19:35.751 --> 00:19:38.040
And he's not
a bad guy, either.

435
00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.330
Not sure I believe you.

436
00:19:41.331 --> 00:19:43.040
You will once
you really meet him.

437
00:19:43.041 --> 00:19:44.960
There's nobody nicer
than Beshte.

The pengie-angie-wins
don't waddle very fast.

440
00:19:48.961 --> 00:19:51.120
It's okay.
Beshte's not here yet.

441
00:19:51.121 --> 00:19:53.670
Hey, wait.
Where's Pinguino?

442
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.250
Eh, he didn't wanna come.

443
00:19:55.251 --> 00:19:56.250
He waddled back home.

444
00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:58.790
But he's the one
who made the biggest fuss.

445
00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.170
He needs to be here.

446
00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:04.290
Anga, can you find Pinguino?
And Beshte, too?

447

Yup.

Don't worry, Rani.

If anybody can find them,
Anga can...

450
00:20:10.001 --> 00:20:12.120
Found them.
RANI: Already?

451
00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:14.120
Which one?
Both.

459
00:20:28.121 --> 00:20:32.080
You're friends with
Poa the Destroyer?

00:20:32.081 --> 00:20:35.170
Yes, except he's not

00:20:40.041 --> 00:20:41.710

Wow.

I don't know.

about this guy.

Stronger than a penguin.
Yet gentle as a penguin.

Ah, thanks.

470
00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:56.710
So, Pinguino?
What happened?

471
00:20:56.711 --> 00:20:59.000
What happened? What happened?

472
00:20:59.001 --> 00:21:01.460
Oh, I'll tell you
what happened.

473
00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:04.500

And then,
suddenly there he was.

477
00:21:09.751 --> 00:21:11.290
Larger than life.

478
00:21:11.291 --> 00:21:13.120
And right underneath me.

479
00:21:13.121 --> 00:21:16.420
I landed on his back.
He's as soft as a penguin.

480
00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.040
You should have seen him
running to catch me.
