79
00:05:42.251 --> 00:05:46.540
Yeah, but isn't she
supposed to be here
on serious business?

80
00:05:46.541 --> 00:05:51.290
Indeed! The water treaty
between the Pride Lands and
the Backlands is very serious.

81
00:05:51.291 --> 00:05:54.210
Yeah. Dhahabu's watering hole
is helping everyone

82
00:05:54.211 --> 00:05:56.250
in the Pride Lands
get through the dry season.

83
00:05:56.251 --> 00:05:58.580
Then let me ask you
a serious question.

84
00:05:58.581 --> 00:06:00.210
Do you think
she remembered me?

85
00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.920
DHAHABU: There you are!

86
00:06:01.921 --> 00:06:03.170
She does!

I've been looking forward
to seeing you again.

Well, Your Majesty.
It's good to see you too.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.460
So, Dhahabu? How 'bout
we show you the local
landmarks?

93
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.960
That sounds delightful.
But a tour has already
been arranged.

Queen Dhahabu around

96
00:06:27.621 --> 00:06:29.620

97
00:06:29.621 --> 00:06:30.920
That's right.

98
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.540
Why don't we all go together?

99
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.880
That way I can catch up with
my old friends, while making
new ones.

without Raha and Starehe?

112

You never go anywhere
without us.

going on a tour?

00:07:31.041 --> 00:07:32.120
Looks like it.

I sure am!

Oh, it will be fun.

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:38.750
Just think of it as going on
patrol, with a special guest.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Fine.

126
00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.290
I always imagined
the Pride Lands
as being greener.

127
00:07:45.291 --> 00:07:49.750
It's very green during
the rainy season.
But this time of year...

128
00:07:49.751 --> 00:07:51.710

and frizzy.

stripes that color? I love it!

I guess.

Well, everyone in the
Pride Lands is grateful
for your help.

This dry season
is especially bad.

the water treaty is for us.

help our Pride Lands friends.

138

I don't like the look
of those clouds.

139
00:08:30.291 --> 00:08:32.210
I do. We could use some rain.

140
00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:37.750
Well, it is raining high up in
the sky. But it's too hot for
the rain to reach the ground.

178
00:10:26.291 --> 00:10:28.380
A Queen's Guard!

179
00:10:28.381 --> 00:10:31.170
Fuli! I've never seen anyone
move so quickly.

180
00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.750
With you by my side,
I would always feel safe.

181
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.170
I would like you to be
my personal guard for
the remainder of my visit!

182
00:10:39.171 --> 00:10:41.420
You... you would?

183
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:44.380
What about me?
Your loyal mongoose!

184
00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:47.170
That's really nice of you,
Your Majesty.

185
00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:50.540
But Fuli's already
a member of the Lion Guard.

186
00:10:50.541 --> 00:10:51.540
So...

187
00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.420
Kion.

188
00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.330
Queen Dhahabu's sharing
her water with us.

189
00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.080
I think we should do
whatever she asks.

190
00:10:59.081 --> 00:11:00.880
Yeah, but...

191
00:11:00.881 --> 00:11:03.080
It's just while she's here.

192
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.170
Your majesty.

193
00:11:05.171 --> 00:11:09.080
I'm sure Fuli would be pleased
to act as your personal guard
for your visit.

194
00:11:09.081 --> 00:11:10.380
I would?

195
00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.120
I mean... I would.

196
00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.830
Wonderful!

197
00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:19.250
And you two! You never left
my side during the ordeal.

198
00:11:19.251 --> 00:11:22.170
I want you to be my guards
as well.

199
00:11:22.171 --> 00:11:23.080
Really?

200
00:11:23.081 --> 00:11:24.170
Ooh, yes.

201
00:11:24.171 --> 00:11:27.710
Tiifu? Zuri?
I was counting on
your help tonight.

202
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:32.250
Remember? Sharing her water?
Do what she asks?

203
00:11:32.251 --> 00:11:34.040
(SIGHS SOFTLY)

204
00:11:34.041 --> 00:11:38.210
I know Tiifu and Zuri would
also be honored to be your
temporary guards.

205
00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:40.120
So honored.

206
00:11:40.121 --> 00:11:42.000
So totally honored.

207
00:11:42.001 --> 00:11:43.040
That's settled.

208
00:11:43.041 --> 00:11:45.670
Now I have my own
Queen's Guard.

209
00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:49.000
I think this calls
for a celebration!

210
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.830
Let's all frolic and romp!

211
00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.500
Frolic and romp!
Frolic and romp!

Frolic and romp!

Come, Fuli! Prance with us!

214
00:12:00.381 --> 00:12:02.080
Frolic. And romp.

215
00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:06.620
Well. My new guards
certainly are enthusiastic.

216
00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.170
And now that I have them,
I won't need you to escort me.

217
00:12:10.171 --> 00:12:11.880
But Your Majesty...

218
00:12:11.881 --> 00:12:14.210
I'm sure you have many
other duties to attend to.

219
00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:17.210
It's okay. She's got Fuli.

220
00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.920
I'll have Ono keep
an eye on them too.

221
00:12:19.921 --> 00:12:21.120
Well, okay.

222
00:12:21.121 --> 00:12:23.880
I do need to help
prepare for tonight's event.

223
00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:26.620
And we'll go on patrol.

224
00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.670

225
00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:31.380
Fuli!

226
00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.710

to report this, skinks!

But the water treaty with
the zebras must be put
to an end.

230

I want the Pride Lands
to stay thirsty.

231
00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:58.880
Perhaps something unfortunate
will happen to the Queen
during her visit.

232
00:12:58.881 --> 00:13:02.080
Something very unfortunate.

233

Bring me Reirei
and the jackals.

234

They're good at
this sort of thing.

235
00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:12.170
With the Queen gone,
there will be no treaty.

236
00:13:12.171 --> 00:13:15.920
And no extra water
for the Pride lands.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:27.040

She didn't look very happy.

very happy either.

Hey, Raha. Starehe.
What are you two up to?

Oh. Frolicking.

Queen Dhahabu.

Is she with you?

247
00:13:43.501 --> 00:13:47.250
Nah. She's still touring
the Pride Lands.
With her new Guard.

248

Her new guard?

249

Oh. We thought she
might need us.

250
00:13:52.381 --> 00:13:54.670
She's never been apart
from us this long.

251
00:13:54.671 --> 00:13:57.040
Don't worry.
We can find her for you.

Would you look at that.

260
00:14:16.541 --> 00:14:19.040
A golden zebra.

261
00:14:19.041 --> 00:14:22.750
I didn't know they came in
different flavors. What you
think it tastes like?

watering hole.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:27.250
This way.

349
00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:35.290
Raha? Starehe? I saw
what you did to protect
Dhahabu.

350
00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:37.330
Why wouldn't you let me
tell her about it?

351
00:18:37.331 --> 00:18:40.330
The Queen loves us because
we're happy and carefree.

352
00:18:40.331 --> 00:18:42.880
She wouldn't want to
see us acting like that.

00:18:42.881 --> 00:18:44.080
Acting like what?

354
00:18:44.081 --> 00:18:46.040
Kion, what're you
talking about?

355
00:18:46.041 --> 00:18:50.170
I think Raha and Starehe would
make a great Queen's Guard!

356
00:18:50.171 --> 00:18:51.000
Them?

357
00:18:51.001 --> 00:18:52.290
BOTH: Us?

358
00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.460
The water feels divine!

359
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.710
How can she be so happy?
Can't she see we're
miserable?

360
00:19:01.711 --> 00:19:05.120
Why are you two so upset?
I thought you loved hanging
out with royalty.

361
00:19:05.121 --> 00:19:07.170
And Dhahabu's a Queen!

362
00:19:07.171 --> 00:19:08.670
It was fine for a day.

363
00:19:08.671 --> 00:19:10.120
Before the jackals showed up.

364
00:19:10.121 --> 00:19:13.120
But we can never leave Kiara.
She's our best friend.

365
00:19:13.121 --> 00:19:15.750
Besides, someday she will
be a Queen too.

366
00:19:15.751 --> 00:19:18.210
And it will be up to us
to help her be a good one.

367
00:19:18.211 --> 00:19:20.620
Wow, I never realized
you felt so...

368
00:19:20.621 --> 00:19:21.710
(GROWLING)

369
00:19:21.711 --> 00:19:23.120
Uh-oh.
Look who's back.

370
00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:26.880
(SIGHS) Not again.

371
00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.250
But our job is to just
frolic and romp.

372
00:19:29.251 --> 00:19:31.540
That's all the Queen
ever wants us to do.

373
00:19:31.541 --> 00:19:34.420
She might think differently
if she saw you two in action.

374
00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:37.580
I wanna see you in action!
C'mon! Show me what you got!

375
00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:41.960
BOTH: Frolic and romp!
Frolic and romp!

376
00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:43.120
I give up.

377
00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:47.000
Sorry. We can't just
turn it on and off.

378
00:19:47.001 --> 00:19:48.670
Something has to really
make us angry.

379
00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:50.830
Okay, so what would it take?

380
00:19:50.831 --> 00:19:53.040
ONO: <i>Hapana!</i> The jackals
are back!

381
00:19:53.041 --> 00:19:56.330
They're attacking the watering
hole! Dhahabu's in danger!

382
00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:58.620
BOTH: Dhahabu's in danger?

383
00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.670
Kick. And. Stomp!

384
00:20:01.671 --> 00:20:03.830
Kick and stomp!
Kick and stomp!

385
00:20:03.831 --> 00:20:05.710
Whoa!
Well, now we know
what it takes.

386
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.580
Come on.
Till the Pride Lands end...

387
00:20:08.581 --> 00:20:11.040
ALL: Lion Guard defend!

388
00:20:11.041 --> 00:20:12.790
(GROWLING)

389
00:20:12.791 --> 00:20:14.080
We wanna help.

390
00:20:14.081 --> 00:20:15.620
Then stay by the Queen!

391
00:20:15.621 --> 00:20:17.210
We won't leave her side!

392
00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:20.210
You shouldn't have
come back, Reirei!

393
00:20:20.211 --> 00:20:22.080
You've already been
beaten once today!

394
00:20:22.081 --> 00:20:25.830
But this time we brought along
some extra teeth!

395
00:20:25.831 --> 00:20:27.250
(GROWLING)

396
00:20:27.251 --> 00:20:29.540
(SCREAMS) Crocodiles!

397
00:20:29.541 --> 00:20:32.710
Surprise, surprise, surprise!

398
00:20:32.711 --> 00:20:34.710
ZEBRAS: Kick and stomp!
Kick and stomp!

399
00:20:34.711 --> 00:20:36.670
You're in for a surprise,
all right.

400
00:20:36.671 --> 00:20:39.380
ZEBRAS: Kick and stomp!
Kick and stomp!

401
00:20:39.381 --> 00:20:41.080
What in the Outlands?

402
00:20:41.081 --> 00:20:42.750
Kick and stomp!

403
00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:53.460
Raha? Starehe?
Is that really you?

404
00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:01.790
I told ya those striped
varmints was mean!

405
00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:04.460
Jackals! Skedaddle!

406
00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:09.040
That was the easiest
fight ever.

407
00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:14.170
Raha! Starehe! I've never
seen you like that.

408
00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:15.880
Sorry, oh Queen.

409
00:21:15.881 --> 00:21:17.460
So embarrassing.

410
00:21:17.461 --> 00:21:20.290
Embarrassing?
I don't think so.

411
00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:22.380
Fuli, Tiifu, Zuri.

412
00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:26.170
I'm sorry, but I no
longer need you to be
my Queen's Guard.

413
00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:30.290
It seems I've had
a Queen's Guard all along.

414
00:21:30.291 --> 00:21:32.380
I just never knew it.

415
00:21:32.381 --> 00:21:34.170
Until now.

416
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.290
And I hope this water treaty
may allow friendship
and goodwill

417
00:21:41.291 --> 00:21:44.710
to flow between
our realms forever!

418
00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:47.500
(CHEERING)

419
00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:54.170
You gonna miss being
Queen Dhahabu's Guard?

420
00:21:54.171 --> 00:21:56.670
I'm happy right where I am.

421
00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:26.830
(CHORUS VOCALIZING)

422
00:22:26.831 --> 00:22:29.040
<i>♪ Look out
Here comes the Lion Guard ♪</i>
