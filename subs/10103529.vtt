(KION READING)

5
00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:12.379
Lion Guard,
keep digging!

6
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.790
Faster!

7
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.500
THURSTON:
Panic and run!
Panic and run!

8
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.880
Kion!
The Zebras
are stampeding!

9
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.119
We'll get to them.

10
00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:23.999
Right now we've
gotta stop this fire

11
00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:26.289
before it spreads
through the Pride Lands!

12
00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.290
Reposition!
Surround the flames,
but stay back!

13
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.670
Beshte, we'll need
a new trench.

14
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.789
You got it, Kion.

15
00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:37.169
(GRUNTING)

16
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.170
Kion! The fire's
at the trench!

17
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.620
Beshte, get out of there!

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:48.669

(FIRE SIZZLES OUT)

21
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.750
Phew! That was close.

22
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.379
(SIGHS) Good work, everyone.

23
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.540
Ono? How bad's the damage?

24
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.750
I'll see what I can see.

25
00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:11.121
Not bad, Kion. It looks like
the zebras still have
plenty of grass left to eat.

26
00:02:11.121 --> 00:02:13.119
The zebras! Ono!

27
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.210
ONO: <i>Hapana.
</i> They're still stampeding!

28
00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:22.379
Till the Pride Lands end...

29
00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.249
ALL: Lion Guard defend!

30
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.960
RAFIKI: Now, Makini...

31
00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.830
One of the Royal Mjuzi's
duties is to paint...

32
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.120
The history
of the Pride Lands!
I know!

33
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.959
And I really want to do
a good job!

34
00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.039
But I've never painted
anything before.

35
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.460
I'm not sure how...

36
00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.960
If you knew how,
you would not need
to learn.

37
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.290
Observe!

38
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.670
Right, yes, okay.
But what do I...

39
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:45.709
Shh.

40
00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:49.039
Yes.

41
00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:52.081
Ooh! You're listening to
the Lions of the Past,
aren't you?

42
00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:54.710
What are they
saying Rafiki? Huh?
What are they...

43
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.170
Oh... <i>Shwari.</i>

44
00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.749
Be calm.

45
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.080
Yes. The Lions of the Past
tell me what the painting
needs to be!

46
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.540
And now I know.

47
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.250
(CHUCKLES)

48
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.170
(HUMMING)

49
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.619
How did you do that?
You make it look so easy!

50
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.000
(LAUGHS) It is easy!

51
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
After it is hard.

52
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.830
Okay...

53
00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:24.619
Hmm.

54
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.080
(LOUD THUD)
Whoa!

55
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.000
CHAMA: We made it!
MHAZA: It's perfect!

56
00:03:31.041 --> 00:03:34.421
I'm not exactly sure
that's what the painting
needed to be.

57
00:03:34.421 --> 00:03:38.329
Most likely it is not.
It seems we have visitors.

58
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.620
Hmm.

59
00:03:40.661 --> 00:03:45.001
FURAHA: (WHOOPING) Three
wild guys like us can
really be at home here!

60
00:03:45.001 --> 00:03:47.379
Indeed. My horns
love this tree!

61
00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:49.919
(WHOOPING, LAUGHS)

62
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.500
Who is living
the good life now, huh?

63
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.250
I am. I am!
(LAUGHS)

64
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.580
Oh, yes. That is funny
because you are tapping me

65
00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.329
and yet when I turn around
no one is there!

66
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.580
(LAUGHING)

67
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.620
(LAUGHING)

68
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.170
Who are you three?
So young and full of life.

69
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.500
Name's Chama,
this is Mzaha and Furaha.

70
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.419
ALL: Chama cha Mzaha
na Furaha! Umph!

71
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.920
(LAUGHING)

72
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.380
And good news
for you, my friend.

73
00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.379
We fun guys
are living here now!

74
00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:25.539
(LAUGHS)

75
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.250
Living the dream,
I'd say.

76
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.540
(LAUGHTER)

77
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.170
Live here? Ha!
You cannot live here.

78
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.119
I need quiet
to train my apprentice.

79
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.580
MAKINI: They won't bother me.

80
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.420
They seem nice.
Makini?

81
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.290
Hey, yeah! We are nice!
Nice and un!

82
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:44.750
Just like you Rafiki!

83
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.540
We see you
around the Pride Lands
talking with King Simba...

84
00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.420
(IMITATES RAFIKI)
Ha ha! I am wise,
and yet I have good time!

85
00:04:51.421 --> 00:04:54.461
Indeed! And that's
why we want to be
your neighbors!

86
00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:57.000
Come on, Rafiki.
It might be fun.

87
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.959
Please. Please. Please?

88
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.460
Eh... Very well.
Yay!

89
00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.420
(ALL CHEERING)

90
00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.710
As long as you are quiet!
(STOPS CHEERING)

91
00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:13.959
Makini must focus
on her training.

92
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.080
She is painting for
the Royal Family tonight

93
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.330
I am?

94
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.420
You must be ready.

95
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.040
Ha! You won't even
know we're here.

96
00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.459
Good. Come, Makini.

97
00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:26.119
(CHAMA BURPS LOUDLY)

98
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.540
(CHUCKLES) Sorry,
won't happen again,

99
00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.540
(LAUGHTER)

100
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.330
(LAUGHING)

101
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.379
Zebras, the fire's out!

102
00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:38.789
BUNGA: Yeah!
You can stop running!

103
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.500
(NEIGHS) Whoa!

104
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.880
Can you tell me what you saw
when the fire started?

105
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.750
Well, I saw the grass...

106
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.619
Because you were grazing?

107
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.290
Why, yes.

108
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.830
Then I saw a big flash
of bright light!

109
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.830
Wait. I actually know
what he's talking about.

110
00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.959
Lightning must have
started the fire!

111
00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.120
Lightning? But there
was no rain.

112
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.830
That's because
it's dry lightning.

113
00:06:04.871 --> 00:06:08.501
It doesn't bring rain.
Quite common in
the dry season, really.

114
00:06:08.501 --> 00:06:10.580
Well there's nothing
to worry about now.

115
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.249
You can all go back
to grazing.

116
00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:13.249
Fabulous.

117
00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.830
Uh, your grazing grounds
are this way.

118
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.460
Oh. Right.

119
00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.750
Ono? Better
show them home.

120
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:23.749
Affirmative.

121
00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:25.669
After me, zebras!

122
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.290
You heard the bird.
After him.

123
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.540
Zebras.

124
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.500
RAFIKI: Ah, yes.
Much better!

125
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.459
KION: Rafiki.

126
00:06:37.501 --> 00:06:40.621
I thought you were
training Makini for
the painting ceremony tonight.

127
00:06:40.621 --> 00:06:43.290
Makini is training.

128
00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:45.830
I am taking a break
from the noise.

129
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.499
What noise?

130
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.290
The noise that is
a young elephant,
monkey and antelope.

131
00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:52.710
They are now
living next to my tree!

132
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:53.880
Next to your tree?

133
00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.420
Why aren't they
with their herds?

134
00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.540
Excellent question,
young hippo.

135
00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.619
And one I could not ask.

136
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:03.460
They do not stop talking.
Except for when Makini talks!

137
00:07:03.461 --> 00:07:06.421
We'd better find out
why they're not
with their herds.

138
00:07:06.421 --> 00:07:10.081
Yes! And perhaps you
and the Lion Guard can take
them somewhere else.

139
00:07:10.081 --> 00:07:12.249
(CHANTING) Bug! Bug! Bug!

140
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.210
And Furaha beats
his bug eating record!

141
00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:23.619
(CHEERING)

142
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:28.120
Bug eating record?
Wait till you see
how many I can eat.

143
00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.580
I think I understand
your problem.

144
00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.670
(SCOFFS) Yeah.
You have three Bungas.

145
00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:36.249
Well, four now.

146
00:07:36.249 --> 00:07:39.329
Makini?
Is this practicing?

147
00:07:39.371 --> 00:07:42.081
I was just taking
a little break.
For inspiration!

148
00:07:42.081 --> 00:07:45.161
But now that
that's over I can really,
really focus on painting!

149
00:07:45.161 --> 00:07:47.670
Hey Chama.
Mzaha. Furaha.

150
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:49.249
Why aren't you guys
with your herds?

151
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:50.880
Uh... Short story, Beshte.

152
00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.120
They kicked us out.
You know how it goes.

153
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.120
Kicked out?
By your own herds?

154
00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.290
Why?

155
00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:58.380
Beats... (BURPS) Me.

156
00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.079
(BURPING) Do not know.

157
00:08:00.079 --> 00:08:01.749
(BURPS) Nope.

158
00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:03.960
(SLURPS) Oh! Oh!
I can burp too!

159
00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.540
(BURPS)

160
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.540
Ugh. Seriously?

161
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.670
I'm sure it's some kinda
misunderstanding.

162
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:12.079
Your herds are
probably worried about you.

163
00:08:12.079 --> 00:08:14.579
We can take you back
to your families.

164
00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:15.960
If that's what you want.

165
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.500
Yes, yes.
Back to their families.

166
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.710
Being with your herd
is part of your role

167
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:22.080
in the Circle of Life!

168
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.750
Circle of Life?
Whoa! In that case,
we better go back!

169
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:27.500
You said it.
Indeed.

170
00:08:27.541 --> 00:08:30.751
But, uh, guess that means
we three gotta
say good-bye, huh?

171
00:08:30.751 --> 00:08:32.960
But without you
two fun guys

172
00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.710
I will just be one fun guy...

173
00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:38.119
Kion, the zebras
are all home safe!

174
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.670
Good work, Ono.

175
00:08:39.711 --> 00:08:43.211
Now I'll need you
and Beshte to take Furaha
back to his troop.

176
00:08:43.211 --> 00:08:45.080
Affirmative,
