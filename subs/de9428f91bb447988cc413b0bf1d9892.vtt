(NARRATOR READING)

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.670
<i>Journey to the Pride Lands.</i>

4
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.830
It is
a difficult decision.

5
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.330
It is.

6
00:01:09.331 --> 00:01:11.040
I have a duty
to the Pride Lands.

7
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.210
My whole family
is there.

8
00:01:13.211 --> 00:01:15.290
But I still have
more to learn about
the Roar.

9
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.670
And the Night Pride
could use our help.

10
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.040
And Rani...
I mean, Queen Rani.

11
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.580
She wants me to stay.

12
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.120
And what do
you want to do?

13
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.750
What do I want?
Yes, Kion.

14
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.250
The decision
is yours to make.

15
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.000
You must choose the path
that is right for you.

16
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.750
The path
that's right for me...

17
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.000
Thank you,
Grandfather.

18
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.250
RANI: Kion?
Rani?

19
00:01:45.251 --> 00:01:46.500
Uh, hi.

20
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.540
Have you thought about
what I said?

21
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.380
You mean about
never being welcome
at the Tree of Life?

22
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.080
(LAUGHS) That was
a while ago.

23
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.330
Funny how things
can change once
you get to know someone

24
00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.920
Yeah, it's true.

25
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.620
We really do make
a good team, Kion.

26
00:02:02.621 --> 00:02:03.960
I know.

27
00:02:03.961 --> 00:02:05.120
The Lion Guard
and the Night Pride

28
00:02:05.121 --> 00:02:06.460
work really
well together.

29
00:02:06.461 --> 00:02:08.170
(CHUCKLES) Well, yeah.

30
00:02:08.171 --> 00:02:10.880
But, I also mean
you and me.

31
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.210

I really could use
your help

80
00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:53.250
keeping
the Tree of Life
at peace.

81
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.620
If I've learned anything
about you, Rani,

82
00:04:55.621 --> 00:04:57.210
it's that you don't need
my help.

83
00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.120
You don't need
anyone's help.

84
00:04:59.121 --> 00:05:00.920
You're a great
leader, Rani.

85
00:05:00.921 --> 00:05:02.620
Thank you, Kion.

86
00:05:02.621 --> 00:05:05.080
I want to be
a great queen
someday, too.

87
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.960
And a great queen

88
00:05:07.961 --> 00:05:09.750
could use
a great king.

89
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.040
Like you.
King?

00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:13.580

91
00:05:13.581 --> 00:05:14.670
Hey, Kion.

92
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.710
Uh, hey,
Bunga.

93
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.250
What's going on?

94
00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:20.000
That's what
we've been
wondering.

95
00:05:20.001 --> 00:05:21.420
You are all
healed now.

96
00:05:21.421 --> 00:05:22.960
And the bad guys
are gone.

97
00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.000
Time to go home?

98
00:05:25.001 --> 00:05:27.040
I've told Kion
you're all welcome

99
00:05:27.041 --> 00:05:28.540
to stay at
the Tree of Life.

100
00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.580
That I'd like you
to stay.

101
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.170
Stay?

102
00:05:32.171 --> 00:05:35.040
Kion, are you
seriously thinking
about staying here

103
00:05:35.041 --> 00:05:37.170
and not going back
to the Pride Lands?

104
00:05:37.171 --> 00:05:39.500
Well, there's peace
in the Pride Lands.

105
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.500
The Night Pride
could use
our help.

106
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.420
And Rani
has become
a good friend.

107
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:45.960
So has Binga.

108
00:05:45.961 --> 00:05:47.500
I've made lots
of friends
here too.

109
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.290
It is tempting
to stay.

110
00:05:49.291 --> 00:05:51.000
The Tree of Life
has so much to see.

111
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.420
Yep.

112
00:05:52.421 --> 00:05:54.040

I don't know.

Queen Rani,

115
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.460
I've spotted
a cheetah, making
his way up the pass.

116
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.540
A cheetah?
AZAAD: <i>Mibinamet!</i>

118
00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:05.210
Wha...
Huh?

119
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.040
Fuli. Queen Rani.

120
00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:11.380
Azaad.

121
00:06:11.381 --> 00:06:12.540
You two know
each other?

122
00:06:12.541 --> 00:06:14.670
Azaad's been to
the Tree of Life before.

123
00:06:14.671 --> 00:06:18.210
Yes. Queen Janna herself
healed Azaad,

124
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.080
after an unexpected fall.

125
00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:22.120
She will be missed.

126
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:23.790
Thank you,
Azaad.

127
00:06:23.791 --> 00:06:25.210
So what brings you
here now?

128
00:06:25.211 --> 00:06:27.080
Another
unexpected fall?

129
00:06:27.081 --> 00:06:29.290
(LAUGHS) No, no.

130
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.000
Two travelers asked
for directions,

131
00:06:32.001 --> 00:06:34.330
and Azaad
has shown them here.

132
00:06:34.331 --> 00:06:35.790
Swift as a cheetah.

133
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.880
It seems
they couldn't keep up.

134
00:06:37.881 --> 00:06:40.670
JASIRI: Azaad.
(COUGHS)
Wait for us.

135
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.290
Jasiri?

136
00:06:42.291 --> 00:06:44.290
Janja?
I'll stop him!

138
00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.500
(GROANS) Oh, Bunga,
get off of me.

139
00:06:48.501 --> 00:06:50.120
I'm on your side now.

140
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.460
Oh, yeah.
I forgot.

141
00:06:52.461 --> 00:06:53.580
KION: Jasiri?

142
00:06:53.581 --> 00:06:54.710
Janja?

143
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.170
What are you
doing here?

144
00:06:56.171 --> 00:06:57.250
It's Zira.

145
00:06:57.251 --> 00:06:59.500
She and her pride
of evil lions are back.

146
00:06:59.501 --> 00:07:01.040
What?
Zira?

147
00:07:01.041 --> 00:07:02.420
Oh, no.

148
00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:03.500
Zira?

149
00:07:03.501 --> 00:07:06.250
She's the leader
of some very bad lions.

150
00:07:06.251 --> 00:07:07.460
My dad
banished them

151
00:07:07.461 --> 00:07:09.170
for betraying
the Pride Lands.

152
00:07:09.171 --> 00:07:10.380
But you roared
those lions

153
00:07:10.381 --> 00:07:11.960
all the way
outta the Outlands.

154
00:07:11.961 --> 00:07:13.460
Yes,
but they're
back now.

155
00:07:13.461 --> 00:07:15.120
And now Zira's son,
Kovu,

156
00:07:15.121 --> 00:07:17.120
and daughter, Vitani,
are fully grown.

157
00:07:17.121 --> 00:07:18.000
Hate to admit it,

158
00:07:18.001 --> 00:07:19.080
but us hyenas

159
00:07:19.081 --> 00:07:21.790
don't stand a chance
against those lions

160
00:07:21.791 --> 00:07:23.830
The hyenas told me
all of this.

161
00:07:23.831 --> 00:07:26.460
It is why I brought
them here as fast
as I could.

162
00:07:26.461 --> 00:07:28.330
And faster than
they could.

163
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.000
Kion?

164
00:07:30.001 --> 00:07:31.170
It's up to
the Lion Guard

165
00:07:31.171 --> 00:07:32.830
to stop Zira
and her pride.

166
00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.120
As long as we have
the Mark of the Guard

167
00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:37.210
we have a duty
to defend
the Pride Lands.

168
00:07:37.211 --> 00:07:38.290
I know.

169
00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:41.000
You can't stay here
if the Pride Lands
are in danger.

170
00:07:41.001 --> 00:07:43.620
Yes. And we have
to go now.

171
00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.000
MAKINI: Kion.

172
00:07:45.001 --> 00:07:46.960
I think
I have to stay.

173
00:07:46.961 --> 00:07:49.290
I'm Queen Rani's
Royal Mjuzi now.

174
00:07:49.291 --> 00:07:51.330
This is my place
in the Circle of Life.

175
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.290
I understand.

176
00:07:53.291 --> 00:07:56.170
I'm sure you'll be
a great Royal Mjuzi,
Makini.

177
00:07:56.171 --> 00:07:57.540
Thanks, Kion.

178
00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.330
Bye, Makini.

179
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.290
We'll miss you.

180
00:08:02.291 --> 00:08:04.330
Affirmative.
Yep.

181
00:08:04.331 --> 00:08:06.620
Say hi to all
the Pride Landers
for me?

182
00:08:06.621 --> 00:08:07.620
We will.

183
00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:11.120
So, Lion Guard,
this is goodbye.

184
00:08:11.121 --> 00:08:12.210
Thank you,

185
00:08:12.211 --> 00:08:14.170
for helping me
defend the
Tree of Life.

186
00:08:14.171 --> 00:08:15.620
I consider
each of you

187
00:08:15.621 --> 00:08:16.880
a member
of my Pride.

188
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.830
Fuli, Bunga,

189
00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:21.920
Beshte,

190
00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.620
Ono, Anga.

191
00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.210
Kion, I know
you need to protect
the Pride Lands,

192
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.830
but I meant
what I said before.

193
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.000
I know.

194
00:08:34.001 --> 00:08:36.080
You,
and your friends,

195
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:39.210
will always be welcome
at the Tree of Life.

196
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.920
Thank you,
Queen Rani.

197
00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:44.620
Come on, Lion Guard,
time to go.

198
00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.170
Till the Pride Lands'
end...

199
00:08:47.171 --> 00:08:49.000
ALL: Lion Guard defend!

200
00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.040
Maybe the Roar
will return again.

201
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:57.040
Someday.

202
00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.250
Thanks for coming
to get us, Jasiri.

203
00:09:01.251 --> 00:09:03.790
You've saved
my family and home
more than once.

204
00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.540
Just returning
the favor.

205
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:10.290
Fuli,
I understand that
you have friends,

206
00:09:10.291 --> 00:09:13.250
but having
hyenas for friends?

207
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.330
Whoa! (GRUNTING)

208
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.920
That seems
very unlikely.

209
00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:23.670
It's a long story,
but they've earned
our trust.

210
00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:29.330
Ono?

211
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:31.830
Still remember all the
<i>moja kwa moja </i> stones

212
00:09:31.831 --> 00:09:32.920
on Rafiki's map?

213
00:09:32.921 --> 00:09:33.920
Indeed.

214
00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.170
<i>The first landmark
back to the Pride Lands</i>

215
00:09:38.171 --> 00:09:39.290
<i>is a giant lake.</i>

216
00:09:39.291 --> 00:09:41.540
Ooh,
I remember that.
Me too.

217
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:46.830
ANGA: Got it!

218
00:09:46.831 --> 00:09:48.290
The lake's
this way.

219
00:09:48.291 --> 00:09:49.920
We'll need
to move fast.

220
00:09:49.921 --> 00:09:52.210
It'll take us a long time
to go around that lake.

221
00:09:52.211 --> 00:09:55.000
And even longer
to get back to
the Pride Lands.

222
00:09:55.001 --> 00:09:58.250
It is a shame
that your friends
are not cheetahs.

223
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:00.080
We could go
this way.

224
00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.460
It would be
much faster.

225
00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.540
Wait, you know
a faster way

226
00:10:05.541 --> 00:10:06.750
to get to
the Pride Lands?

227
00:10:06.751 --> 00:10:07.960
But of course.

228
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:09.380
I have travelled much,

229
00:10:09.381 --> 00:10:10.790
and know
the fastest routes

230
00:10:10.791 --> 00:10:12.210
to all of
the Great Lands.

231
00:10:12.211 --> 00:10:15.040
Alas, I do not think
your hippo friend

232
00:10:15.041 --> 00:10:17.040
would fit on the path
we'd need to take.

233
00:10:17.041 --> 00:10:19.830
Kion, if you need to
leave me behind
I understand.

234
00:10:19.831 --> 00:10:21.620
Before we decide
anything,

235
00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:23.250
I want to take
a look and see.

236
00:10:23.251 --> 00:10:25.040
Azaad,
show us the way.

237
00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:26.040
Follow me.

238
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.460
The fastest way

239
00:10:32.461 --> 00:10:34.040
is through
this canyon.

240
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:37.750
BESHTE: Oh!

241
00:10:37.751 --> 00:10:39.460
That is a narrow path.

242
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:40.830
BUNGA: Hmm.

243
00:10:40.831 --> 00:10:41.920
Hmm.

244
00:10:41.921 --> 00:10:43.170
Yeah, I don't think

245
00:10:43.171 --> 00:10:44.880
you're gonna fit
through there, Big B.

246
00:10:44.881 --> 00:10:46.920
Is this
the only way, Azaad?

247
00:10:46.921 --> 00:10:49.120
It is
the fastest way.

248
00:10:49.121 --> 00:10:50.460
The way of
the cheetah!

249
00:10:50.461 --> 00:10:52.710
Not the way
of the hippo. Sorry.

250
00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:56.000
So, guess we go back
and take the slower way?

251
00:10:56.001 --> 00:10:57.080
No.

252
00:10:57.081 --> 00:10:58.880
If this is
the fastest way,

253
00:10:58.881 --> 00:11:00.330
then this is
the way we're going.

254
00:11:00.331 --> 00:11:01.420
Get behind me.

255
00:11:01.421 --> 00:11:03.750
(LAUGHS) I know
what that means.

256
00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:07.000
But you cannot
all fit.

257
00:11:07.001 --> 00:11:09.500
How...
Just wait.
It's un-Bunga-lievable!

258
00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:12.620
(ROARING LOUDLY)

259
00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:29.750
(LAUGHS HEARTILY)
Gotta love the Roar.

260
00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.000
Very well.
The fast way it is.

261
00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.380
AZAAD: We will need
to cross this ravine.

262
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:42.540
(CHUCKLES)
That's deep
and wide.

263
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:44.880
Deep and wide!

264
00:11:44.881 --> 00:11:46.580
(ECHOES) Deep and wide.

265
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.750
A cheetah
could just
leap across

266
00:11:50.751 --> 00:11:52.170
But the nearest
land bridge

267
00:11:52.171 --> 00:11:54.120
may take days
to reach.

268
00:11:54.121 --> 00:11:57.000
We need to get back
to the Pride Lands
as fast as we can.

269
00:11:57.001 --> 00:11:59.210
We just need to
get across
this ravine?

270
00:11:59.211 --> 00:12:00.120
AZAAD: Yes.

271
00:12:00.121 --> 00:12:01.670
The path
to the Pride Lands

272
00:12:01.671 --> 00:12:03.380
continues
on the other side.

273
00:12:03.381 --> 00:12:05.120
But...
That's all I needed
to hear.

274
00:12:05.121 --> 00:12:07.500
Ooh, ooh!
Me first!
Me first!

275
00:12:07.501 --> 00:12:10.120
(LAUGHS) Okay, Bunga,
you first.

276
00:12:10.121 --> 00:12:11.210
First?

277
00:12:11.211 --> 00:12:13.210
First
for what?
You'll see.

278
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.380

279
00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.210

That's what
I'm talking about!

282
00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:35.080
So,
who's next?

283
00:12:35.081 --> 00:12:36.330
Next? Whoa,

284
00:12:36.331 --> 00:12:39.120
no way I'm going across
the ravine like that!

285
00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:40.790
Don't worry,
Janja.

286
00:12:40.791 --> 00:12:42.920
Kion's learned
lots of new ways
to use the Roar.

287
00:12:42.921 --> 00:12:45.210
Indeed. It's
perfectly safe.

288
00:12:45.211 --> 00:12:47.920
Easy for you to say.
You can fly.

289
00:12:47.921 --> 00:12:49.710
Don't tell me
you're scared.

290
00:12:49.711 --> 00:12:52.420
What? Me? Scared?
(SCOFFS) No way!

291
00:12:52.421 --> 00:12:54.120
Good.
Go ahead, Kion.

292
00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:55.580
(ROARING)
Wait,
wait, wait!

293
00:12:55.581 --> 00:12:59.210
It's just that
I don't wanna fly!

294
00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.290
See? That wasn't
so bad, was it?

295
00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:06.710
It was fun.
Yeah.

296
00:13:06.711 --> 00:13:09.170
Better than
all the other times
Kion's roared at me.

how will
you get across?

Now which way
do we go?

It's like Kion

They're really
good friends,

Yeah.

Really good

and follow
the river bed
to its mouth.

319
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.080
Is it far?

Farther than
even I can see.

If you were
all cheetahs,

we could make it

Oh, I think
I can get us there
way before sunset!

to get this dead tree

Kion.

532
00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:56.790
As I said,

533
00:22:56.791 --> 00:22:58.540
the Pride Lands
are not far
from here.

534
00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.210
We will be
there soon.

535
00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:14.120
Hey, this place
looks familiar.

536
00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:15.830
JASIRI: It does.

537
00:23:15.831 --> 00:23:19.170
Yes. We have reached
the Outlands.

538
00:23:19.171 --> 00:23:20.380
Yep.
And look.

539
00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:23.290
ONO: I see it, too!
FULI: Pride Rock.

540
00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.080
We made it.
We're almost home.

541
00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:28.920
Yes.
The Pride Lands.

542
00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:30.670
But we can't
stop now.

543
00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.120
We need to find Zira
and stop her.

544
00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:35.080
Till the Pride Lands
end...

545
00:23:35.081 --> 00:23:37.000
ALL: Lion Guard defend!

546
00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:39.880

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:50.210
