Oh, no.
I don't think it was...

The hyenas and jackals
are heading across
the Outlands together!

107
00:06:11.751 --> 00:06:14.420
Together?
But they don't even
like each other!

108
00:06:14.421 --> 00:06:17.670
Indeed. Hyenas have
even been known
to hunt jackals.

Bleurgh. Who'd want
to eat jackals?

110

weren't a coincidence!

112
00:06:26.581 --> 00:06:28.120
Why would they do that?

113
00:06:28.121 --> 00:06:32.120
To split us up!
That way, they both
had us outnumbered!

114
00:06:32.121 --> 00:06:34.750
And if they did it once,
they might do it again.

what are we going to do?

173
00:09:05.581 --> 00:09:07.790
Hyenas, jackals.
Not sure which.

174
00:09:07.791 --> 00:09:11.580
You do remember that
the last time I almost ended
up as hyena food, right?

175
00:09:11.581 --> 00:09:14.620
Don't worry, Tamaa.
We won't let anything
happen to you.

176
00:09:14.621 --> 00:09:16.250
Really? You promise?

177
00:09:16.251 --> 00:09:19.920
I think a clever bird
like you should be able
to handle himself.

178
00:09:19.921 --> 00:09:22.710
Yeah. We're just dealing
with jackals and hyenas.

179
00:09:22.711 --> 00:09:23.750
Not somebody smart.

180
00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:26.080
JANJA: The plan
worked, Scar.

181
00:09:26.081 --> 00:09:27.880
The Lion Guard
split up to chase us!

182
00:09:27.881 --> 00:09:29.750
Just like you said they would!

183
00:09:29.751 --> 00:09:31.830
That's right.
(LAUGHS)

184
00:09:31.831 --> 00:09:33.880
We had 'em chasing
their own tails.

185
00:09:33.881 --> 00:09:35.830
Excellent.

186
00:09:35.831 --> 00:09:37.210
Yeah, yeah! But, uh...

187
00:09:37.211 --> 00:09:38.750
Why'd we go to
all that trouble?

188
00:09:38.751 --> 00:09:40.290
We still came back
with nothin'!

189
00:09:40.291 --> 00:09:42.750
These first attacks
were merely a test

190
00:09:42.751 --> 00:09:45.040
to see if Kion
would react as I predicted.

191
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:49.040
The next attack is
the one that counts.

192
00:09:49.041 --> 00:09:52.880
Because next time your target
will be Rafiki!

193
00:09:52.881 --> 00:09:54.330
Rafiki?

194
00:09:54.331 --> 00:09:56.580
You want to get rid of
that old monkey?

195
00:09:56.581 --> 00:10:00.120
That "old monkey"
is dangerous.

196
00:10:00.121 --> 00:10:04.080
He has the ability to sense
the Lions of the Past.

197
00:10:04.081 --> 00:10:07.830
Ooh, ooh!
That means
he can sense you!

198
00:10:07.831 --> 00:10:10.380
Amazingly, you're right.

199
00:10:10.381 --> 00:10:14.250
And I don't want
anyone in the Pride Lands
to know I've returned...

200
00:10:14.251 --> 00:10:16.580
At least, not yet!

201
00:10:16.581 --> 00:10:19.960
Okay. Me and my boys
will head to Rafiki's Tree.

202
00:10:19.961 --> 00:10:22.040
Reirei's jackals
can distract the Guard

203
00:10:22.041 --> 00:10:24.120
by goin' after some
zebras or somethin'.

204
00:10:24.121 --> 00:10:26.500
I think my pack
should eliminate Rafiki

205
00:10:26.501 --> 00:10:29.330
while you fur-brains go after
something you can handle,

206
00:10:29.331 --> 00:10:31.290
like a couple of grass rats!

207
00:10:31.291 --> 00:10:33.210
We'll deal with Rafiki!

208
00:10:33.211 --> 00:10:36.500
You don't send a jackal
to do a hyena's job!

209
00:10:36.501 --> 00:10:37.710
SCAR: Enough!

210
00:10:37.711 --> 00:10:39.920
Janja, you can have Rafiki.

211
00:10:39.921 --> 00:10:43.750
Reirei, the jackals
can take lead next time.

212
00:10:43.751 --> 00:10:45.460
Humph.

213
00:10:45.461 --> 00:10:49.120
But the skinks
have informed me that
Rafiki is not at his tree

214
00:10:49.121 --> 00:10:53.170
He's near Mapango Cliffs
meditating.

215
00:10:53.171 --> 00:10:54.830
Oh, okay, Scar. Don't worry.

216
00:10:54.831 --> 00:10:59.580
We'll find him.
If Reirei can keep half of
the Lion Guard away from him.

217
00:10:59.581 --> 00:11:02.670
We jackals always do our job.

218
00:11:02.671 --> 00:11:05.250
Then Rafiki'll never know
what hit him.

219
00:11:05.251 --> 00:11:06.620
Good.

220
00:11:06.621 --> 00:11:09.500
Then proceed with the plan.

221
00:11:09.501 --> 00:11:12.380
Divide... And conquer!

222
00:11:12.381 --> 00:11:15.080
(LAUGHS MALICIOUSLY)

223
00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:21.040
Ya hear that, Reirei?
Scar's lettin' me
take care of Rafiki!

224
00:11:21.041 --> 00:11:23.330
'Cause us hyenas
are smarter!

225
00:11:23.331 --> 00:11:26.380
Smarter than who?
A grub worm?

226
00:11:26.381 --> 00:11:28.750
Smarter than you,
that's who!

227
00:11:28.751 --> 00:11:30.880

00:13:25.541 --> 00:13:27.040
Didn't see them.

267

Maybe those other attacks
were a coincidence after all.

I still don't think so.
