Why were you trying
to scare everybody?

27
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.830
We weren't! We were
just playing Lion Guard!

28
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.040
(CHUCKLES)
Playing Lion Guard?

29
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.040
And it was our turn
to be the bad guys!

30
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.579
It was all
Mtoto's idea!

31
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.460
Are you Mtoto?

32
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.960
Mmm-hmm.

33
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.460
Ono, want to give
the all clear?

34
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.290
Affirmative.

No hyenas here!

37
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.830
So you guys
were pretending to
be the Lion Guard?

38
00:02:29.871 --> 00:02:33.251
Oh, yeah! We each
take turns being
different members!

39
00:02:33.251 --> 00:02:36.249
Except Mtoto,
he's always Beshte!

40
00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:38.789
Really? Me? Poa!

41
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.420
Who gets to pretend to be me?

42
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.880
You know,
whoever is last.

43
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.290
Say what?

44
00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.880
Well, little Lion Guard,

45
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.959
this isn't the best time
to pretend to be hyenas.

46
00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:52.541
I saw Janja and his hyenas
sneaking into the Pride Lands
yesterday.

47
00:02:52.541 --> 00:02:54.330
And they're still
around here...

48
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.500
Somewhere.

49
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.210
So you can see
why everyone got so upset.

50
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.249
We never meant
to scare anybody!

51
00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:02.459
We won't do it again!
Promise!

52
00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.210
Hi, little guy.

53
00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:11.579
Uh... Did you want
to ask me something?

54
00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:12.709
Uh...

55
00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:13.960
How's it feel
to be so strong?

56
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.380
What's it like
to fight bad guys?

57
00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.380
Can you really
knock down a tree
with your head?

58
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.420
How's it feel to
be a real live hero?

59
00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:23.119
Oh, well,
I'm not really.

60
00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:25.379
It's the whole team.
Not just me.

61
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:29.661
Hey! Maybe the real
Lion Guard could play
Lion Guard with us!

63
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.880

64
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.499
But with hyenas
on the loose,

65
00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:36.039
we need to
stay sharp.

66
00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:38.039
Lion Guard! Time
for some training.

67
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.880
Sounds good!
Zuka Zama!

68
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.920
Well, I'd better
get going.

69
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.250
Aw.

70
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.539
Can't you stay just
a little longer, Beshte?

71
00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:48.829
Please?

72
00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.670
Hmm.

73
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.290
Say, Mtoto,
how'd you like to
come watch us train?

74
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.080
Poa! That'd be awesome!

75
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.080
Okay! C'mon,
Mtoto, let's go!

76
00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:02.169
I can't believe it.

77
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.710
I'm gonna train with
the real live Lion Guard!

78
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.080
So you really do like
the Lion Guard, huh?

79
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.540
Who doesn't?
You guys are
the greatest!

80
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.419
Kion is a great leader.

81
00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.709
And Fuli's just so fast!

82
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.500
Bunga's not afraid
of anything. And Ono...

83
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.250
But you're
the biggest reason
I like the Lion Guard!

84
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.620
Well, I guess
I am the biggest...

85
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.789
Not like that, Beshte.

86
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.920
I think you're the best!

87
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.790
Uh, well... Thanks.

88
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.540
I don't know what to say.

89
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.960
Hey, look!

90
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.209
There's Kion
and the others!
Come on!

91
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.830
We need to be ready
to chase down Janja
wherever we find him.

92
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.750
(SCOFFS)
I'm always ready.

93
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.960
Hey, guys.
Sorry I'm late.

94
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.789
I, uh, invited Mtoto
to come along.

95
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.080
Okay.

96
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.790
Well, we were just about
to run an obstacle course.

97
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.210
Poa!
Can I run it, too?
Whoa!

98
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.750
Sure, I guess.

99
00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.329
Stick with him, Beshte.

100
00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.250
Ono, keep an eye out
for hyenas while we're
running this one.

101
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.750
Affirmative!

102
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.210
The sky's probably
the safest place to be.

103
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.580
Everybody follow me!

104
00:05:10.829 --> 00:05:12.669

run around 'em!

Oh! Uh, okay!

110
00:05:24.709 --> 00:05:26.289
You're gonna
love this, Fuli.

111
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.500
Argh!

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:37.329
You'll do anything to
stay dry, won't you?

114
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.710
You know it.

115
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.080

I'm, I'm sorry!

123
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.209
Yeah, well...

124
00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.040
It's just water.

125
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.420
Told you the sky
was the safest place
to be.

126
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.670
Yeah, why don't
we try something
totally different.

127
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.210
Oh, okay!

128
00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.209
I'll do a lot
better this time!
You'll see!

129
00:06:12.209 --> 00:06:14.079
Sure you will, Mtoto.

130
00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.080
Hmm, let's run
a stealth surround drill.

131
00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.170
Yeah, yeah!
Where we practice
sneaking up

132
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.289
on bad guys and
surround them.

133
00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:25.959
Haven't done
that in a while.
Sounds good to me.

134
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.250
I always ace
this one.

135
00:06:28.291 --> 00:06:31.251
Okay, I'll go to
the other side of
that big rock pile.

136
00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:33.080
The rest of you
try to sneak up,

137
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.039
without me seeing
or hearing you.

138
00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:36.999
Ono? Keep watch
for hyenas

139
00:06:36.999 --> 00:06:38.209
while we're running
this one?

140
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:39.250
Affirmative!

141
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.290
You know the drill.

142
00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:42.500
Wait till
I'm out of sight.

143
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.920
Then try to
surround me.

144
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.250
You got it, Kion.

145
00:06:48.579 --> 00:06:50.579
Okay. I'll approach
from this side.

146
00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.250
You two go in
from that side.

147
00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.790
Kion'll never
see me coming!

148
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.540
Sneaking up on
someone isn't so
easy for us hippos.

149
00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:59.879
Unless we're
in the water.

150
00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:01.669
Aw, you'll be
great at it!

151
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.170
You can do anything!

152
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:04.620
I don't know
about that,

153
00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.040
but we'll give it
our very best try!

154
00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.250
Hey, Kion,

155
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.749
how's it going?

156
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:25.539
(LAUGHS) Got me.

157
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:26.830
You're good, Fuli.

158
00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.750
(SMIRKS) I know.

159
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.580
Walk softly...

160
00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:31.960
Easy does it...

161
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:40.790
I don't think
Kion heard.

162
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.000
Let's keep moving.

163
00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.290
Hey, Beshte, what
about going this way?

164
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:53.830
Zuka Zama!

165
00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.080
Gotcha!

166
00:07:57.121 --> 00:08:00.331
(CHUCKLES) Bunga,
what happened to
sneaking up on me?

167
00:08:00.331 --> 00:08:02.169
Eh, I got
tired of that!

168
00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:04.460
Running right
at ya's more
my style.

169
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.500
So, that just
leaves Beshte.

170
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:07.960
And Mtoto.

171
00:08:09.579 --> 00:08:12.329
(WHISPERING) You're really
good at this, Mtoto.

172
00:08:12.329 --> 00:08:14.249
I can't even hear you.

173
00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:17.330
Mtoto?

174
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:20.540
Guys, guys!

175
00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:21.750
Beshte?
What's wrong?

176
00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:24.579
It's Mtoto! I can't
find him anywhere!

177
00:08:24.579 --> 00:08:26.119
I'm right here, Beshte!

178
00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.960
I was just sneaking, uh...

179

Mtoto!
Whoa! (GRUNTS)

180
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.710
Hang on, Mtoto!
I'm coming!

181
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:33.880
Oh...

182
00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.379

Mtoto, are you okay?

186
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:43.290
I think so...

187
00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:46.500
(GROANS) I'm okay too.

188
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.879
Mtoto? Why didn't
you stay with me?

189
00:08:48.879 --> 00:08:50.919
I wanted to show you
I could do a good job

190
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.620
sneaking up on Kion.

191
00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.330
Sorry, I messed up.

We're just glad
you're not hurt, Mtoto.

194
00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:01.209
But I think it's time
for you to head home.

195
00:09:01.209 --> 00:09:03.169
Yeah. I guess so.

196
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:04.750
I'll walk you.

198
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:08.540
Bye, everybody.

199
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:15.790
I don't think he saw us.

Yeowch! Watch it!

201
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.960

hear us, fur brain!

Yeah!

203

They don't call Ono
"The ears in the sky"
for nothin'!

That's not what
they call him!

to rescue me.

kept an eye on you.

where've you been?

290
00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:57.620
And the Lion Guard.

291
00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:00.330
Wow! Did they
make you a member?

292
00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:02.829
Not officially, but...

293
00:13:02.871 --> 00:13:06.871
So you probably don't
want to play pretend

You kidding?

295

to be hyenas.

It's always more
fun with somebody
to chase.

the hyenas...

you didn't.

you're both faster

for Beshte while
you're up there?

gotten back by now!

can it take to walk a

Argh! They got away!

356
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:36.289
What do you want
to chase now?

357
00:15:36.289 --> 00:15:37.579
I got an idea!

358
00:15:37.579 --> 00:15:40.379
How's about
we chase you?

359
00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:42.170
ALL: Hyenas! Ah!

Ow! No fair. Kicking!

Janja! They're
gettin' away!

373
00:16:14.169 --> 00:16:16.829
And that little
zebra's mean!

374
00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:17.960
Doesn't matter.

375
00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.000
There's still
the little elephant.

376
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.040
And he's the
slowest one.(LAUGHS)

377

(LAUGHTER)

378
00:16:25.669 --> 00:16:28.709
Seriously. There's no
reason to be afraid.

379
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:29.960
Maybe not for them!

380
00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.330
But zebras are the
most delicious animals

381
00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:35.040
in the Pride Lands and
the hyenas know it!

Whoa, kids! What's
the kerbubble?

387
00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:46.080
And where's Mtoto?

388
00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.580
(GULPING BREATH)
Mtoto's being chased!
By the hyenas!

(SCOFFS) Oh, not again!

390

little troublemakers!

394
00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:02.119
Not for long!
Stay here!

395
00:17:02.119 --> 00:17:04.039
Oh, now, really!

396
00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:06.170
Who's going to protect me?

(DEEP BREATH)

398
00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:21.420
Well? Anything?

399
00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:23.920
Well, the good news is,
I didn't see any hyenas.

400
00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.039
The bad news is,
I also didn't see Beshte.

401
00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.540
Hmm.

402
00:17:28.581 --> 00:17:31.791
It's not like Beshte
to wander off when
we're on alert.

403
00:17:31.791 --> 00:17:33.250
Something's wrong.

404
00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:35.040
C'mon. We've
gotta find him.

Won't be long now.
He's getting tired.

407
00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:43.290
(HEAVY BREATHING)
Me, too!

408
00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:45.250
All right, fellas.
Let's get him.

409
00:17:50.079 --> 00:17:53.079
Hey, little buddy!
Looking for help?

410
00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:56.000
It's no use.
Nobody's coming.

411
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.920
Just you and us.

412
00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:02.539
So which do you prefer,
boys? Leg or trunk?

413
00:18:02.539 --> 00:18:07.209
(GASPS)
I like the ears!
They're chewier!

414
00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:10.620
Chewy ears!
That sounds funny!

415
00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:14.080
(LAUGHS)
And delicious!

416
00:18:14.579 --> 00:18:15.999
Uh...

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:23.790
(YELPS) Beshte!
You came for me!

420
00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:26.039
Sure, I did!
You can swim, right?

421
00:18:26.039 --> 00:18:27.709
Mom hasn't
taught me yet.

422
00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:29.580
Then hop up!

423
00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:31.000
Now hang on!

424
00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:36.250

What do we do now?

425
00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:37.829
Follow that hippo!

426
00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:41.960
I don't see
Beshte anywhere.

427
00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.000
Or his little
elephant buddy.

428
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.880
Aren't those
Mtoto's friends?

429
00:18:47.619 --> 00:18:49.169
Have you guys
seen Beshte?

430
00:18:49.169 --> 00:18:50.619
He went to
save Mtoto!

431
00:18:50.619 --> 00:18:51.999
From the hyenas!

432
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.290
What?
Where?

433
00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:56.790
That way! Janja and
the hyenas chased us!

434
00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:59.210
We got away
but Mtoto didn't!

435
00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:00.829
Ono, we have
to find them!

436
00:19:00.829 --> 00:19:01.999
I'm on it!

437
00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.830
JANJA: C'mon, boys!
We're catching them!

438
00:19:12.829 --> 00:19:14.749
Hey! They passed us!

439
00:19:14.749 --> 00:19:16.749
Maybe they're just going
in the same direction!

440
00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.000
Or maybe not!

441
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.250
Mtoto, duck!

The current's slower
through here.

449
00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.880
I should be able
to make better time.

450
00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.580
Almost home, Mtoto!

451
00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:45.830
Uh-oh! Look!

452
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:47.710
What do we do now?

453
00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:49.119
I've got an idea.

454
00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.330
Hapana!

That's never
a good thing!

I need to tell
the rest of the guard.

458

Mtoto, ready for
stealth mode?

459
00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.080

stealth mode.

They're getting closer!

465

your trunk trick?

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:36.420
Oh, yeah!

You know, they'd
stand a better chance

488
00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:25.619
if they just got
out of the river.
