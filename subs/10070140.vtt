00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.750
It's in Mirihi Forest.

183
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.919
That's way out
in the Back Lands.

184
00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:26.499
That's right.

185
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:30.500
But I really like it
here in the Pride Lands.

186
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.420
The trees are more comfy.

187
00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:34.879
Really?

188
00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:37.749
Oh, hey!
I have an idea.

189
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:41.380
Maybe the galagos and I
could share the tree?

190
00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.250
We'd have all kinds of
fun together, right?

191
00:07:45.379 --> 00:07:47.329
(GALAGOS SCREAMING)

192
00:07:47.329 --> 00:07:50.289
The leopard is not
staying in our tree!

193
00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:52.290
The galagos are right,
Badili.

194
00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:53.580
You need to go back home.

195
00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:56.830
(SOBBING)
Do I really have to?

196
00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:58.540
(CLEARS THROAT)
Uh, I mean...

197
00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.209
Are you sure you don't
wanna keep me around?

198
00:08:01.209 --> 00:08:02.829
I'm lots of fun!

199
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:04.960
I'm great at games!
Wanna play tag?

200
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:07.620
Not with those claws.

201
00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.500
Badili,
is there a reason

202
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.619
you don't want
to go home?

203
00:08:10.619 --> 00:08:13.749
(NERVOUSLY) What?
No, don't be silly.

204
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:15.580
Of course
I want to go home.

205
00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:16.960
It's my home.

206
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:21.170
I just, you know, uh,
wanted to try a new home

207
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:22.580
for a while.

208
00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.039
And you did.

209
00:08:24.039 --> 00:08:25.919
But now
it's time to go back
where you belong.

210
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.330
We'll even
walk you there.

211
00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:28.460
You will?

212
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.500
Oh, that's great.

213
00:08:30.541 --> 00:08:33.331
'Cause I definitely wasn't
going to wait until you left

214
00:08:33.331 --> 00:08:35.290
and climb up
that tree again.

215
00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:36.419
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

216
00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:39.169

as silly as an elephant

Badili home now.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.080
Uh, thank you, Kion!

223
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:54.620

Great! That's fantastic.

00:09:12.789 --> 00:09:14.879
Hey, is anyone else parched?

230
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.750
We passed a watering hole
a while ago.

231
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:20.330
I say we double back
and check it out.

232
00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.540
Badili,
what's goin' on?

233
00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:25.540
You keep making excuses
like you don't want to
go home.

234
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:27.000
Excuses?

235
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.420
No way!

236
00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:30.080
I can't wait to be home.

237
00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.620
Almost there. Yay!

238
00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.670
So, thanks for the walk.

239
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:36.329
Maybe we'll see each other
again some time.

240
00:09:36.329 --> 00:09:37.619
There we go.

241
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:38.710
Now,
anyone else think

242
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:40.330
that watering hole
sounded good?

243
00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:43.500
Wait, Bunga.
Something's not right.

244
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:44.420
Come on.

245
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:54.790
So, this is...
This is all good, right?

246
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:56.460
We can go?
Not yet.

What's the matter,
Badili?

251
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:09.080
Scare ya?

252
00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.170
Um, maybe a little.

253
00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:13.289
A little?
Okay, a lot.

254
00:10:13.289 --> 00:10:16.379
Correct me
if I'm wrong,

255
00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:20.670
but I thought I told you
this ain't your turf no more.

256
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:21.960
I know, I know, but...

257
00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.579
Didn't I make
myself clear?

258
00:10:23.579 --> 00:10:26.619
Was I speaking a language
you don't understand?

259
00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:28.620
Uh...

260
00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:29.710
No.

261
00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:31.210
So why'd
you come back?

262
00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:33.210
I... I... I...

You... You... You...
You what?

264
00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:37.249
You miss me?

265
00:10:37.249 --> 00:10:40.209
Forget how much bigger
and how much stronger I am?

266
00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:42.620
Oh. Oh, no.
No, I remembered.

267
00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:45.580
That Mapigano is
not a nice leopard.

268
00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.670
Yeah, but Badili
can't just let him
take over his home!

269
00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:52.379
(SIGHS)
I think he already did.

270
00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.330
All of this
is my turf now.

271
00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:55.750
So you need to scram.

272
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:57.000
Again.

273
00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.580
I did go away.

274
00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.329
But this is my home.

275
00:11:00.329 --> 00:11:01.749
It's where I belong.

276
00:11:01.749 --> 00:11:03.499
So...

277
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.830
Here we go. And now
he's gonna tell him.

281
00:11:11.959 --> 00:11:14.419
Why wouldn't Badili
stick up for himself?

282
00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:17.420
Maybe he needs someone
to stick up for him.

283
00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:18.960
Share it?

284
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.250

285
00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:25.000

a better idea!

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:45.620
Says the Lion Guard!

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.290
Badili's our friend.

296
00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:50.499
You mess with him,
you mess with us.

297
00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.540
And believe me,
you don't wanna
mess with us.

298
00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:55.880
Why do you even care?

299
00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.880
Look at him.
He's not even a leopard.

300
00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.710
He's a scaredy-cat!

301
00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:00.879
He is a leopard.

302
00:12:00.879 --> 00:12:02.879
And this is his turf.

303
00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.750
That means
you have to go back
where you came from!

304
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:06.830
Or don't.

305
00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:08.880
But then,
we'll have trouble.

306
00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.710
I don't think
you'd like that.

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:19.210
I wasn't gonna stay.

thank you guys?

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.580
You don't have to
thank us at all, Badili.

319
00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:35.829
This is what we do.

320
00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:37.539
But why didn't
you just tell us

321
00:12:37.539 --> 00:12:39.579
a mean leopard kicked you
out of your territory?

322
00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.540
I was embarrassed.

323
00:12:41.581 --> 00:12:45.371
Leopards
are supposed to be fierce
and fight for their turf.

324
00:12:45.371 --> 00:12:47.210
But I get too scared.

325
00:12:48.289 --> 00:12:49.829
It's okay to be scared.

326
00:12:49.829 --> 00:12:51.419
You don't have
to be embarrassed.

327
00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.290
Actually, Mapigano's
the one who's scared now.

328
00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:55.710
He's already far away.

329
00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:57.710
And he's gone for good.

330
00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:00.040
He knows the Lion Guard
has your back.

331
00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.119
Thanks, guys.

332
00:13:01.119 --> 00:13:02.249
You're the best.

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:03.620
Our pleasure, Badili.

334
00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.920
Maybe we'll see you
again sometime.

He's back in our trees!

351
00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:44.750
I'm sure he wants
to eat us this time!

Badili? No way.

353
00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:47.749

00:14:01.039 --> 00:14:02.039
(GRUNTS)

361
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.000
Oh! Hi, guys!

362
00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.380
Great to see you again!

363
00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:09.960
Thanks for dropping in!

364
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.000
Badili,
you're supposed
to be back home.

365
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.289
What happened?

366
00:14:13.289 --> 00:14:15.709
(SIGHS) Mapigano.

367
00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:16.880
The mean leopard?

368
00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.710
But we chased him off!

369
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:21.250
I know.
You were amazing!

370
00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:25.080
(SIGHS) It was so peaceful
and nice with him gone.

371
00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:28.790
But then he came back.

372
00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:30.880
Hmm.

373
00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.830
You know, I think
we made a big mistake.

374
00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:36.250
We never should have
gotten rid of Mapigano.

375
00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:38.459
What?
No, you should have!

376
00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.000
It was the best!

377
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.540
In fact,
I was kind of hoping
you might do it again?

378
00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:44.920
Sure!
We'll take care
of him for you.

379
00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.880
Let's go!
No!

380
00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:50.000
We're not helping Badili
by scaring that other
leopard away for him.

381
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.539
We need to teach you
how to stand up for yourself.

382
00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:55.210
You mean,
teach me to fight?

383
00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:57.250
I don't know
if I can do that.

384
00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:58.960
You don't have to.

385
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.040
We didn't have to
fight Mapigano when
we scared him away.

386
00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.039
No...

387
00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:06.040
But you're
the Lion Guard.

388
00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:09.250
Yeah, but Mapigano
didn't know anything
about us.

389
00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:11.420
He just saw
we wouldn't back down.

390
00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:13.959
But I will back down.

391
00:15:13.959 --> 00:15:17.329
I'm not confident
like you guys.

392
00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:18.960
The only reason
we're confident

393
00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.460
is because we believe
in ourselves.

394
00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:24.000
You just need to
believe in yourself, too.

395
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.879
How am I gonna do that?

396
00:15:25.879 --> 00:15:27.619
I'm not like you.

397
00:15:27.661 --> 00:15:33.751
You're the fiercest,
bravest, fastest, strongest
and keenest of sight!

398
00:15:33.751 --> 00:15:36.920
I'm just a nice leopard
that wants to be left alone.

399
00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.829
Badili, look at me.

400
00:15:38.871 --> 00:15:42.501
That mean leopard
is picking on you because
he knows you'll back down.

401
00:15:42.501 --> 00:15:46.040
But you can still be nice
and stand up for yourself.

402
00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.120
Beshte's
the perfect example.

403
00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:51.879
He's a super-nice guy,
but he's still confident.

404
00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.250
And you can be, too.

405
00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:55.620
But how?

406
00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:57.960
I think we can
help you there.

407
00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.830
Yeah!
I can help you learn to
be fast on your feet.

408
00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:02.379
And I can help you
get stronger.

409
00:16:02.379 --> 00:16:03.789
I'll teach you
to be brave!

410
00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:05.880
And I'll teach you
to be...

411
00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:06.920
Huh.

412
00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.170
I can't really teach you
to be keener of sight.

413
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:11.120
(GASPS) You could
teach him how to fly!

414
00:16:13.119 --> 00:16:14.669
Or not.

415
00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:17.330
Ono, you can help Badili
with eye contact.

416
00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:18.620
Looking
someone in the eyes

417
00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:20.040
lets them know
you're confident

418
00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.880
and fierce!

419
00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.750
I see what you mean.

420
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:25.669
So what do you say, Badili?

421
00:16:25.669 --> 00:16:27.709
It sounds great.

422
00:16:27.751 --> 00:16:30.921
But I'll never be
as good as you guys
at all that stuff.

423
00:16:30.921 --> 00:16:33.000
You don't have to be.
Fuli's right.

424
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.120
As long as you believe
in your own abilities,

425
00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.079
you'll be confident enough
to stand up to Mapigano.

426
00:16:38.079 --> 00:16:39.709
You really think so?

427
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:40.880
I know so.

428
00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:43.670
Okay.

429
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:45.250
Let's do it!

What do you think, Badili?

456
00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:54.080
Ready to face Mapigano?

457
00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.710
I can't wait.

458
00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:01.580
So when you
talk to Mapigano,
what do you do?

459
00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.999
I speak calm and strong,

460
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.040
I stand tall,

461
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.120
and I look him in the eyes.

462
00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:10.120
And if he calls
you a mean name,
what do you say?

463
00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.290
I say, "My name's Badili.

464
00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:14.539
"Use it."

465
00:18:14.539 --> 00:18:16.169
And if he tells you
to go away?

466
00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:17.880
I say, "No.

467
00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.750
"This is my turf."

468
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:21.710
How about if he tries
to scare you?

469
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:23.750
He can't.
He's not scary.

470
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:25.829
He's just a leopard,

471
00:18:25.829 --> 00:18:27.209
same as me.

472
00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:29.540
And how do you know
he's not scary?

473
00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:32.120
Because I found my roar.

474
00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.080
Better believe it.

475
00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.120
Now go take back your turf.

476
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.880
We're gonna stay
and watch, right?

477
00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.210

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:58.830
I happened.

483

I'm totally gonna
use that line.

484
00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:03.209

Where are all
your little buddies?

486

Did you bring 'em along
to stand up for you again?

487
00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:10.000
Nope. Just me.

488
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.420
This is my turf.

489
00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.539
That means
you have to go.

490
00:19:13.539 --> 00:19:15.209
You tell him, Badili.

491
00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:16.580

492
00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:19.040

No!

I believe in Badili.

505
00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:45.170
He can do this himself.

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:47.330

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:54.920
I'm the keenest of sight.

537
00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:58.120
And what I saw was a leopard
standing up for himself.

538
00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:00.290
I couldn't have
done it without you.

539
00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:01.919
Thanks for
believing in me.

540
00:21:01.919 --> 00:21:04.619
No.
You believed
in yourself.

541
00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:06.290
That's what
really counts.

542
00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:08.790
And now that you
have your turf back,

543
00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:11.710
we can let the galagos know
it's safe to go home.

544
00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:14.289
Oh, yeah.
Uh, tell 'em I said "Hi."

545
00:21:14.289 --> 00:21:16.079
And, um, "Sorry."

546
00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:20.830
(SIGHS)
Now this is more like it!

547
00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:24.750
Yep. Everything's right
in the Pride Lands again.

548
00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:28.289
LAINI: Help!
Lion Guard! Help!

549
00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:30.710
Come quick!
There's someone
in our tree!

550
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:32.210
(SIGHS) Not again.

551
00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.040
You're not gonna
believe this.

552
00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:38.419
(ALL SNORING)

553
00:21:38.419 --> 00:21:39.709
Bunga?

554
00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:41.460
Oh, hi, guys.
What's up?

555
00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.290
You are!

556
00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:45.290
What are you doing
in their tree?

557
00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:47.120
I just had to come back.

558
00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.330
These guys are
so soft and cuddly!

559
00:21:51.329 --> 00:21:52.419
Come here, Laini!
(GASPS)

560
00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:54.580
Give me a hug.
(GASPS)

561
00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:57.290
Maybe that leopard
wasn't so bad after all.

562
00:21:57.290 --> 00:22:00.710
(ALL LAUGHING)
