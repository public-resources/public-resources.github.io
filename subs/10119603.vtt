00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.500
Nope. Too bad he's not here.

7
00:01:11.501 --> 00:01:13.250
Ono could spot Ono for sure.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.080
Wait. There he is!

You won't be
so lucky next time!

21
00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:48.420
Yeah. We'll catch you
sooner or later.

22
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.830
You guys couldn't catch
an updraft with both wings.

a beak-full of dirt for lunch.

25

Thanks. It was a little
too close for me.

What'd you see, Ono?

27
00:02:05.461 --> 00:02:08.380
The crocs and jackals
are still in Kilio Valley.

28
00:02:08.381 --> 00:02:10.710
But the hyenas are
moving towards the volcano.

29
00:02:10.711 --> 00:02:12.420
Maybe Scar
has plans for Janja.

30
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:13.790
Maybe.

31
00:02:13.791 --> 00:02:14.880

because you chased me.

160
00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.210

you were spooking
