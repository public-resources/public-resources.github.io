00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.210
Now it's your turn
to be "it" and my turn
to hide!

10
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.080
Yeah, okay, fine.
But first...

11
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.120
Could you move your paw?

12
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.250
(SIGHS) I still don't
get it, Kion.

13
00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.870
Why are we playing
hide-and-seek
in the first place?

14
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.709
It's not just
hide-and-seek.

15
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.380
It's a way to practice
our tracking skills.

Ah, that does
sound better.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.000
Yeah! Besides, it's fun!

How long did it take Kion
to find you two?

19
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.379
Somehow he found me
right away.

20
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.170
He laughed when
I walked past him.

21
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.250
Kion found me
pretty fast, too.

22
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.920
What about Beshte?
Haven't you found him?

23
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.960
Oh, yeah, I found him.

24
00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.879
I just haven't told him yet.

25
00:01:58.879 --> 00:02:00.419
Okay, Beshte!

26
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.960
You can come out
from behind

You got me.

28

Pretty good hiding place,
though, right?

29
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.290
I have to admit,
for someone your size,

30
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:10.999
you're a surprisingly
good hider.

standing on my hoof.

I was? I'm sorry!

meet you, Ajabu.

I won't bite.

that looks like you.

pretty much everyone
in the Pride Lands.

I'm not from
around here.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.500
I believe it.

58
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.119
So Ajabu, are you a zebra?
Or a giraffe?

59
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.750
Neither! I'm an okapi.

60
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.620
An okapi? <i>Poa!</i>

61
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.750
I've never met
an okapi before.

62

Well, there aren't many of us.
Even back home.

63
00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:50.079
How come you were hiding
in the bushes?

64
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.540
It's what I do.

65
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.540
Hide in bushes?

66
00:03:53.581 --> 00:03:57.161
Oh, not just bushes.
I hide behind trees,
behind rock piles...

67
00:03:57.161 --> 00:04:00.039
Oh, if I see a hole,
I'll hide in the hole.

68
00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:01.669
Why do you hide so much?

69
00:04:01.711 --> 00:04:05.621
Where I come from,
it's the smartest thing
for an okapi to do.

BESHTE: Come back out!
That was just Twiga.

76
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.959
She's a nice giraffe.
No need to hide from her.

77
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.920
Back where I come from,
you can't be too careful.

78
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.380
Where do you come from?

79
00:04:29.421 --> 00:04:33.541
A place far away
with lots of bushes
and plenty of trees,

80
00:04:33.541 --> 00:04:35.249
a fair amount of rock piles.

81
00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:36.829
A hole or two.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.500
So why'd you leave?

84
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.580
Oh, I got chased out.

85
00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.580
Guess I didn't hide
well enough.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.789
Who chased you out?

87
00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:48.039
A leopard.

88
00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:50.459
Okapis are a leopard's
favorite food.

Well, you've got
nothing to hide
from here.

any leopards

I could stop hiding?

Well, sure.

like that?

(SHOUTS)

171
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.620
(GRUNTS)

172
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.210
(LAUGHING)

173
00:09:12.999 --> 00:09:15.619
Wow! He sure can jump!

174
00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:17.380
Pretty fast, too.

175
00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:19.670
This guy's not gonna
be easy to catch.

176
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:20.960
Did you see the gazelles?

177
00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.790
They weren't scared
of the leopard at all.

178
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:25.750
That's why we've got to get
him out of the Pride Lands.

179
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:28.250
None of the herds know
that leopards are hunters.

180
00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:31.380
So, they don't realize
they should be scared.

181
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.000
They're all going to be
sitting ducks!

182
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.670
Especially the ducks.

183
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:36.459
That's why
we gotta find him.

184
00:09:36.459 --> 00:09:39.249
Now let's split up
so we can cover
more ground.

185
00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:43.330
Fuli, you're with me.
Bunga, you Ono and...

186
00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.290
Hey, where is Beshte?

187
00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:46.750
I bet he's still hiding.

188
00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:48.829
Don't worry, Kion.
We'll find him.

189
00:09:48.829 --> 00:09:51.579
Yeah. Let's go, Ono!

190
00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.880
<i>Zuka Zama!</i>

191
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.040
(LAUGHS)
You're right, Beshte.

192
00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.920
The Pride Lands really
do seem great.

193
00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.829
See? What did I tell ya?

194
00:10:00.829 --> 00:10:02.959
There's plenty to eat,
and no need to hide.

195
00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.670
You could...
BUNGA: Beshte!

196
00:10:04.711 --> 00:10:07.791
Here you are!
We've been looking
everywhere for you.

197
00:10:07.791 --> 00:10:10.750
Ono! Found him!

198
00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:13.169
Actually, I think
I saw him first.

199
00:10:13.169 --> 00:10:15.879
Maybe, but I got
here first.

200
00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.540
(SIGHS) Fine.

201
00:10:17.581 --> 00:10:21.751
Hi, guys. I've been giving
my new pal Ajabu
a tour of the Pride Lands.

202
00:10:21.751 --> 00:10:24.169
What new pal
are you talking about?

203
00:10:24.169 --> 00:10:25.829
This one here! Aja...

204
00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:28.330
Huh? He was here
a second ago.

205
00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.170
Ajabu? Ajabu!

206
00:10:32.791 --> 00:10:35.791
What's this Ajabu look like?
Maybe I've seen him around.

207
00:10:35.791 --> 00:10:38.919
Probably not.
He's new to the Pride Lands.

208
00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.790
I think I'm the only one
who's seen him.

209
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:42.920
I didn't see him.
I only saw you.

210
00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.380
So what's he look like?

211
00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:48.290
Well... His top half
looks like a giraffe,

212
00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:50.499
his bottom half
looks like zebra,

213
00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:53.670
and his face kind of
looks like an oryx

214
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:55.380
but without the horns.

215
00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.790
Sounds different.

216
00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:00.169
Is that one new pal
or three new pals?

217
00:11:00.169 --> 00:11:03.079
Just one. He's a nice guy.
You'd like him.

218
00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.880
And you're the only one
who can see him?

219
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:10.420
No, no. I'm just the only one
who has seen him.

220
00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:11.919
Uh, Beshte?

221
00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.580
Maybe you've been hiding
all alone a little too long.

222
00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:17.250
No, seriously,
he was right here.

223
00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:20.790
Sure he was, Big B!
But we gotta go now.

224
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:23.750
The Lion Guard
needs us. Right Ono?

225
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.789
Affirmative. Follow me!

226
00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:37.999
Beshte. Glad they could
find you.

227
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.670
Sorry about that.
What's the kerbubble?

228
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:42.330
There's a leopard
in the Pride Lands.

229
00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.960
(GASPS) A leopard?
Are you sure?

230
00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.670
Yeah, we chased him,
but he got away.

231
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:48.999
This is terrible!

232
00:11:48.999 --> 00:11:51.419
I'm pretty sure
we can handle one leopard.

233
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:52.880
You don't understand.

234
00:11:52.921 --> 00:11:56.421
I told Ajabu
there aren't any leopards
in the Pride Lands.

235
00:11:56.421 --> 00:11:58.330
Who's Ajabu?
My new friend.

236
00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.789
I think your new friend's
safe, Beshte.

237
00:12:00.789 --> 00:12:03.829
The leopard will be
going after real animals.

238
00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:04.960
Ajabu is real!

239
00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.420
And is he here
right now?

240
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:11.960
Of course not!
Least, I don't think so.

241
00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.539
Unless he's hiding.
(GRUNTS)

242
00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:16.880
Ajabu? Ajabu!

243
00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:19.880
What's going on?

244
00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.790
Beshte has
an imaginary friend.

245
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:23.420
He's not imaginary!

246
00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:25.539
He looked pretty
imaginary to us.

247
00:12:25.539 --> 00:12:27.379
You didn't even see him.

248
00:12:27.421 --> 00:12:30.251
Guys! We don't have time
to talk about this
right now.

249
00:12:30.251 --> 00:12:32.960
Kion's right.
We've got a leopard
on the loose.

250
00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.000
And it's up to us
to catch him.

251
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.039
Right. You got it, Kion!

252
00:12:37.039 --> 00:12:40.289
Now, let's go!
Till the Pride Lands' end...

253
00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:42.420
ALL: Lion Guard Defend!

254
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:50.870
More leopard tracks.
Makucha definitely
came this way.

255
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:54.830
Yup! Looks like we're on
the right "track." Get it?

256
00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.710
Get what? We are on
the right track.

257
00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:00.420
This is a track
and it's the right one.

258
00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.829
It was kinda funny, right?

259
00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:04.040
Well...

260
00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.080
The leopard's headed
this way.

261
00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.880
Yeah. But it's hard
to tell

262
00:13:07.921 --> 00:13:10.791
which way he went
after he got into
the tall grass.

263
00:13:11.379 --> 00:13:12.959
Hey! I see him!

264
00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:15.209
There he goes!
(GASPS) Come on!

265
00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:16.920
How come I didn't see him?

266
00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.710
I think he went this way.

267
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:20.120
I still don't see him.

268
00:13:24.419 --> 00:13:26.499

(GRUNTS)

272
00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:41.040
(SIGHS) I could've sworn
I saw him run this way.

273
00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.210
You sure it was the leopard?

274
00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:45.080
The leopard?
No, I thought I saw Ajabu.

275
00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.170
Who?

276
00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:47.380
(SPITTING)

277
00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:51.539
Hang on. We've been chasing
your imaginary friend?

278
00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.290
He's not imaginary!

279
00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:56.920
Big B? You know none of us
have seen him, right?

280
00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:58.880
It's true.

281
00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.789
But guys. He really is real.

282
00:14:01.789 --> 00:14:03.329
Why don't you believe me?

283
00:14:03.371 --> 00:14:06.211
I don't know.
Maybe because your
half-zebra half-giraffe friend

284
00:14:06.211 --> 00:14:07.670
sounds so un-Bunga-lievable!

285
00:14:11.959 --> 00:14:15.169
Bunga, you really
hurt his feelings.

286
00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:17.040
Why don't you two
believe him?

287
00:14:17.081 --> 00:14:18.961
You heard what the guy's
supposed to look like.

288
00:14:18.961 --> 00:14:21.830
Half zebra,
half giraffe,
half oryx.

289
00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:23.170
And we didn't see him,

290
00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:25.459
even when Beshte said
he was right there.

291
00:14:25.459 --> 00:14:27.079
Do you believe him?

292
00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:30.040
I do. Beshte doesn't
make things up.

293
00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.920
Besides, did you hear him
say his new friend

294
00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.380
was chased here
by a leopard?

295
00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:35.959
Yeah, so?

296
00:14:35.959 --> 00:14:38.619
So we have a strange animal

297
00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.830
who says he was chased here
by a leopard.

298
00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:43.620
And we have a leopard!

299
00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:47.710
When you put it that way,
it does sound real.

300
00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:50.169
I didn't mean to hurt
his feelings.

301
00:14:50.169 --> 00:14:51.709
We should go say
we're sorry.

302
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:52.920
Good idea.

303
00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:59.250
Hey, Big B?
Don't be mad.

304
00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:02.249
We're sorry we didn't believe
your friend was real.

305
00:15:02.249 --> 00:15:04.329
He just sounded made-up.

306
00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:06.330
Sorry. (SPITS)

307
00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.380
(SIGHS) That's okay.

308
00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:11.080
He does look different
from anyone I've ever seen.

309
00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:13.039
I might not have
believed me, either.

310
00:15:13.039 --> 00:15:14.919
So we're pals again?

311
00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.880
We always were,
Little B.

312
00:15:16.921 --> 00:15:20.581
Okay, guys.
Don't forget, we still
have a leopard at large.

313
00:15:20.581 --> 00:15:23.080
And if we believe
in Beshte's friend,

314
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.000
we've got to believe
that the leopard's
looking for him.

315
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.499
That's right! So we've got to
find him first!

316
00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:32.120
Beshte! Wait for us!

317
00:15:38.249 --> 00:15:39.669
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

318
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:43.000
Well, Beshte did say
the Pride Lands were safe.

319
00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.380
Oh, hello, there.

320
00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:50.209
Hi. Nice to meet ya.

321
00:15:50.209 --> 00:15:52.789
Oh, nice stripes.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.750
Hello.

323
00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:02.290
Not to get
personal, stranger,
but are you a zebra?

324
00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:05.709
Uh, no. I'm not.

325
00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:08.210
(GASPS) I knew it!

326
00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:09.830
You're not a zebra!

327
00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:11.750
(GROWLING)

328
00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:14.119
Look who's here.

329
00:16:14.119 --> 00:16:16.289
I know that. I said I'm not.

330
00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:18.420
Well, what are you then?

331
00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:20.750
Are you a short giraffe?

332
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:23.000
(LAUGHS) No. I'm a...

333
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.169

No. I'm a...

335
00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:29.040
Shh, shh!
Wait, don't tell me.

336
00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.210
You're a...
You're a... Hmm.

337
00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:33.000
Leopard!

338
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.380
Leopard? What's that?

339
00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:38.079
Something big and mean
with sharp teeth!

340
00:16:38.079 --> 00:16:40.039
And it's coming this way!

341
00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.960
Mmm-hmm. So it is.

342
00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:46.170
Well, in that case,
my advice is...

343
00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:48.670
Panic and run!
Panic and run!

344
00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:51.579
Panic and run!

345
00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:54.040
The leopard! Come on!

346
00:16:54.081 --> 00:16:59.711
Makucha! I... I can't believe
you chased me all this way!

347
00:16:59.711 --> 00:17:01.499
You okapis are rare.

348
00:17:01.499 --> 00:17:04.459
Once you find one,
you stay on its trail.

349
00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:08.040
And your trail is about
to come to an end.

350
00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.330
(LAUGHING)

351
00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:11.420
Panic and run!
Panic and... (YELLS)

352
00:17:13.209 --> 00:17:16.499
I know I'm delicious,
but don't eat me! Please!

353
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:18.210
(GROWLS)

354
00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:22.000
I'm after somebody
a lot tastier than you.

355
00:17:23.459 --> 00:17:27.879
Well! I've never been
so insulted in all my life.

356
00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:30.500
KION: Till the
Pride Lands' end...

357
00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:33.120
ALL: Lion Guard Defend!

358
00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.250
Ugh! Not these guys again.

359
00:17:38.379 --> 00:17:41.829
Somebody tastier than me...
I mean, really?

360
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:43.080
(SCOFFS)

361
00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:46.210
Anybody else think it's weird

362
00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:49.000
that the leopard didn't go
after any of the zebras?

363
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.709
Yeah, now that you
mention it.

364
00:17:50.709 --> 00:17:54.459
(GASPS) I bet Ajabu
was hiding in the herd!

365
00:17:54.501 --> 00:17:57.251
Remember I said
his back half is striped
like a zebra's?

366
00:17:57.251 --> 00:17:59.040
He'd blend right in.

367
00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.330
So you think the leopard
was after your new pal?

368
00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:03.709
He did say leopards
chase okapis all the time

369
00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:05.120
where he came from.

370
00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:07.080
Well, they're in
the Pride Lands now.

371
00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:11.210
And the Lion Guard
is gonna keep Ajabu safe!

372
00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:14.169
Thanks. I knew he could
count on you guys.

373
00:18:14.169 --> 00:18:15.419
(YELLS)

374
00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:17.290
What is that thing?

375
00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:18.880
(YELLS)
BESHTE: That's Ajabu!

376
00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:21.750
Well, I'll be
a baboon's brother!

377
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:23.620
Ajabu's actually real?

378
00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.249
You said you believed me.

379
00:18:25.249 --> 00:18:28.419
We did, but now
we really believe you.

380
00:18:28.461 --> 00:18:31.831
(GROANS) Anyway, I'm glad
you've finally seen him.

381
00:18:31.831 --> 00:18:34.170
Uh-oh! So has the leopard!

382
00:18:35.249 --> 00:18:38.249
Lion Guard, let's go!

383
00:18:38.249 --> 00:18:42.419
Leave me alone, Makucha!
Just go back home, won't you?

384
00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:46.170
No way! I've chased you
too far to give up now.

385
00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:47.750
(GROWLING)

386
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:48.749
(SHOUTS)

387
00:18:50.289 --> 00:18:52.669
<i>Poa!</i> Nice move, Ajabu!

388
00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:56.750
Now you're just
making me mad!

389
00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:58.210
(YELLS)

390
00:19:00.079 --> 00:19:01.539
I've got you now!

391
00:19:01.539 --> 00:19:04.619
Not on my watch!
<i>Twende Kiboko</i>

392
00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:05.880
(GROANS)

393
00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:09.330
Wow!
You okay, Ajabu?

394
00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:10.880
I'm fine!

395
00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.620
(GROWLING)

396
00:19:14.249 --> 00:19:16.459
Why don't you mind
your own business?

397
00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:19.290
I'm just saying hello
to an old friend.

398
00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:21.210
This is our business.

399
00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:23.420
And you're not acting
too friendly.

400
00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:26.879
So leopards say hello
with their teeth,

401
00:19:26.879 --> 00:19:28.329
so what?

402
00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:31.420
So it's time for you
to say goodbye!

403
00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.790
Come on! I can fight two
at once!

404
00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:35.460
(GROWLS)

405
00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.579
Let's make it three!
What's the matter?

406
00:19:38.579 --> 00:19:41.459
Honey badger got
your tail? (LAUGHS)

407
00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:43.960
Ugh! I hope you taste
better than you smell.

408
00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.250
Incoming!

409
00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:46.500
(ONO GRUNTS)

410
00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:50.880
(LAUGHS) You guys
are amazing!

411
00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.459
Thanks. Now you stay here.

412
00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:54.830
I'll be right back!

413
00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:59.380
(SNARLING)

414
00:20:01.289 --> 00:20:02.789
(BELLOWING)

415
00:20:02.789 --> 00:20:05.499
Fine! Have it your way!

416
00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.580
Not even an okapi
is worth this.

417
00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:09.420
BUNGA: Whoa!
(BELLOWS)

418
00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:12.170
Don't stop till you're
out of the Pride Lands!

419
00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:14.329
Bunga, let go!

420
00:20:14.329 --> 00:20:15.579
Good idea!

421
00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:17.500
Whoa!

422
00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.790
And don't come back!

423
00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:25.920
Guess I told him.
(CHUCKLES)

424
00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.870
Hey, everybody,
I've got someone
I want you to meet.

425
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:32.420
Kion, Fuli, Bunga, Ono...

426
00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:34.460
This is my
new friend Ajabu.

427
00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:35.750
Hello.
Hi.

428
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:38.379
Ajabu, meet the Lion Guard.

429
00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:42.330
Hi, everyone.
I don't know how to
thank you for saving me.

430
00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:43.460
It's what we do.

431
00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:46.380
(SNIFFING)

432
00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:49.580
(GASPS) Are you
a honey badger?

433
00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:51.539
I sure am!

434
00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:54.330
(LAUGHING) Wow! I've heard
of honey badgers,

435
00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:57.580
but I never believed
they were real.

436
00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:59.580
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

437
00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:02.540
I figured nobody
could look and smell
like that.

438
00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:06.000
I thought they had
to be made up.
But you're real!

439
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.420
Yep! I'm as real as it gets!

440
00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:12.120
You're not planning on
going back home, are you?

441
00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.379
That leopard will be
waiting for you.

442
00:21:14.379 --> 00:21:16.039
What else am I gonna do?

443
00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:18.080
I think I've got an idea.

444
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.460
Mom, Dad?

445
00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:23.420
Ajabu came to
the Pride Lands
as a visitor,

446
00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:25.459
but he'd really
like to stay.

447
00:21:25.459 --> 00:21:27.039
If he has your blessing.

448
00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:29.500
Of course, Ajabu.

449
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.580
You're welcome to stay
in the Pride Lands.

450
00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:33.460
For as long as you like.

451
00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:36.380
Oh, thank you, Your Highness!
Thank you!

452
00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:38.669
We're happy to
have you here, Ajabu.

453
00:21:38.669 --> 00:21:40.209
(ALL CHEERING)

454
00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:42.460
Welcome to the Pride Lands!

455
00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:48.120
So Ajabu. Now that
you're a Pride Lander,

456
00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.539
what do you want
to do next?

457
00:21:49.539 --> 00:21:50.959
Ha! I know!

458
00:21:50.959 --> 00:21:52.459
Let's play some more
hide-and-seek!

459
00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:54.500
AJABU: Okay. (CHUCKLES)

460
00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:57.040
Un-Bunga-lievable!

461
00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.710
He's really good at that!

462
00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:00.330
(LAUGHS)
