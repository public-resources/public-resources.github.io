00:08:12.539 --> 00:08:14.249
A mud slide!
Straight ahead!

182
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:16.000
Uh, yes, sire.

183
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.330
ONO: And the mud's headed
right for...

184
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:18.920
The ostrich herd's nest!

185
00:08:18.961 --> 00:08:21.961
If we don't move fast,
the mud will sweep the eggs
off the cliff!

186
00:08:21.961 --> 00:08:23.039
Affirmative.

187
00:08:23.039 --> 00:08:24.619
I was just about to say that.

188
00:08:24.619 --> 00:08:26.499
We'll have to act fast.

189
00:08:26.541 --> 00:08:30.621
I'll move that log,
so it diverts the mud
away from the nest!

190
00:08:30.621 --> 00:08:31.960
What should we do?

191
00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.500
Just stick together
and follow me.

192
00:08:35.579 --> 00:08:38.379
Just stick together
and follow him?

193
00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.540
That's what he said.

194
00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:41.040
And he is the King.

195
00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.670
Our eggs!
Our eggs!

196
00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:45.620
This way, Lion Guard!

197
00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:47.289
Jump from rock to rock!

198
00:08:47.289 --> 00:08:49.709
Uh, jump from
rock to rock?

199
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:51.830
Usually, Kion just has me
run through the mud.

200
00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:54.170
Yeah, but Kion's not
in charge right now.

201
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:55.500
Simba is.

202
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.170
Lion Guard,
come on!

203
00:08:57.211 --> 00:09:00.501
And it sounds like
he really wants us
to follow him.

204
00:09:00.501 --> 00:09:01.709
Just try your best?

205
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:05.290
Okay. Here goes.

(FULI YELPS)

211
00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:17.330
There.

212
00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:18.920
That should do the trick.

213
00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.290
Now let's continue our patrol.

214
00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:23.120

216
00:09:24.249 --> 00:09:25.789
We're gonna hit the log!

217
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:27.540
Lion Guard, the log!

218
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.500
It's rolling
towards the nest!

219
00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:30.500
I'll grab the eggs!

221
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:33.080
Or maybe I won't.

222
00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.380
There's too much mud.
I can't fly.

223
00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:36.619
I got this.

(GRUNTING)

225
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.960
Good thinking, Big B!

226
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.170
Now the log's not gonna
roll over the eggs.

227
00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:44.670
But the log was protecting
the eggs from the mud.

228
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:45.830
Oh, no!

229
00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:47.169
(GASPS) Grab the eggs!

230
00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:55.460
(GASPS) We missed one!

231
00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:56.460
I have it!

232
00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:05.920
Ostriches,
your eggs are safe.

233
00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.750
Thank you, Your Majesty.

234
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:09.170
Thank you.

235
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:12.580
To think our eggs were
personally saved by the King!

236
00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:13.959
What an honor!

237
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.420
It was my pleasure, Mbuni.

238
00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.380
So, our first mission
was a success.

239
00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.540
Uh, yes, Your Majesty.

240
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.079
Yeah!
Yep.

241
00:10:25.079 --> 00:10:27.709
Affirmative.

242
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:30.960
KION: Is this really
the trail to Udugu?
NALA: It is.

243
00:10:31.001 --> 00:10:32.620
If you tell us
where Udugu is,

244
00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:34.750
I bet I can find
an easier path.

245
00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:36.879
There is no
easy path to Udugu.

246
00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.080
But there is a way
to get through all these
thorns without a scratch.

247
00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:42.080
See?

248
00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.580
Yeah!

249
00:10:43.621 --> 00:10:46.331
I can crawl under the branches
to get through the thorns.

250
00:10:46.331 --> 00:10:48.209
Ow. (GRUNTS)

251
00:10:48.209 --> 00:10:49.669

what I meant.

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:53.080
(CHUCKLES) Of course not.

254
00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.920
Over the thorns
is the way to go.

is understanding me.

...fine.

...what I'm doing.

265
00:11:12.499 --> 00:11:14.289
I hope they make it.

This is definitely... (GRUNTS)

267
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.880
...the right way, Kiara.

268
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.620
I'm almost through!

269
00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.750
And I'm almost at the branch.

270
00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.579
After that it'll be...

Right, Mom?

272
00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:27.500

Your first rescue
with the King.

I wonder what our next
challenge will be.

280
00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.830
Well, let's go, Lion Guard.

281
00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:01.750
At least he's not mad at us
for almost losing that egg.

282
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:02.789
Why should he be?

283
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:05.790
It's not your fault
you can't jump like a lion.

284
00:12:05.831 --> 00:12:09.751
What's the point of being
a team if we're all
gonna do the same thing?

285
00:12:09.751 --> 00:12:12.080
Fuli, he's the King!

286
00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.539
He's gotta know
what he's doing.

287
00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:15.830
Doesn't he?

288
00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:19.330
Maybe we just need to do it
more Simba's way?

289
00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.710
Everyone!
Everyone!

290
00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:23.670

Nothing over here.

We'll find her.

to keep looking.

I can't find her either.

If we knew where
this Udugu place was,

309

maybe we could
meet her there.

There!

up to that grassland.

They're unstable.

what he's doing.

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:28.880
Maybe it doesn't.

364
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.790
There's a ledge
and a trail.

365
00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.120
I bet Mom jumped up there.

366
00:15:34.999 --> 00:15:36.619
Then we will too.

367
00:15:36.619 --> 00:15:37.829
Ready?

368
00:15:37.829 --> 00:15:39.959
One, two, three!

369
00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.750
(BOTH GRUNTING)

370
00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.080
Not even close.

371
00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.540
If Mom could get up there,
we can too.

372
00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:50.329
Mom's twice
our size, Kion.

373
00:15:50.329 --> 00:15:52.829
How can we keep tracking her
if we can't jump up?

374
00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:54.920
I've got it!

375
00:15:54.961 --> 00:15:58.161
I'll give you a boost,
then you can
keep tracking her.

376
00:15:58.161 --> 00:15:59.750
But what about you?

377
00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:02.079
One of us has
to boost the other,

378
00:16:02.079 --> 00:16:04.499
and the truth is...

379
00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:05.920
You're the better tracker.

380
00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.830
I won't argue that.

381
00:16:07.871 --> 00:16:11.711
Though you're the one
who saw the tracks
and figured out Mom jumped.

382
00:16:11.711 --> 00:16:13.619
So we make a good team.

383
00:16:13.619 --> 00:16:15.209
And that's how
we'll find Mom,

384
00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:16.880
by working together.

385
00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.120
Now up you go.

386
00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.790
(STRAINING)

387
00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:24.460
Whoa!
I gotcha! Hang on.

(STRAINING)

389
00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.710
Just a little closer.

390
00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.250
How's that?

391
00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:35.000
(STRAINING) I think
I'm gonna make it.

392
00:16:35.669 --> 00:16:36.749
Yes! (PANTING)

393
00:16:37.579 --> 00:16:38.709
We did it!

394
00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.120
(GASPS) I don't believe it.

395
00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.380
Kiara, what's going on?

396
00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.500
Hello down there.

397
00:16:48.919 --> 00:16:50.329
(CHUCKLES) Mom!

398
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.540
Mom, why did
you disappear?

399
00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:00.290
I thought you were gonna
show us the way to Udugu.

400
00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:02.879
Actually, I think you've
already found Udugu.

401
00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:05.170
We have?

402
00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:06.710
Is it that big rock?

403
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:07.830
No, Kion.

404
00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:09.920
Come on down, Kiara,
and I'll explain.

405
00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.960
Uh, okay.

406
00:17:13.289 --> 00:17:16.079
You see, kids,
Udugu isn't a place.

407
00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:19.120
Udugu is another word
for kinship.

408
00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:22.120
It's the special bond
between siblings.

409
00:17:22.161 --> 00:17:26.461
You found Udugu when
you decided to work
together to look for me.

410
00:17:26.461 --> 00:17:28.039
We did?
Yes.

411
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.080
And I'm very proud of you.

412
00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:34.830
Un-Bunga-lievable.

413
00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:36.579
You're one lucky lion.

414
00:17:36.579 --> 00:17:38.419
You could have
gotten smushed.

415
00:17:38.419 --> 00:17:40.079
Don't worry,
Your Majesty.

416
00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.210
We'll get you free.

417

(OSTRICHES SCREAMING)

418
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:45.170

420
00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.460

Well?
It's what?

422
00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.040
Sorry. I thought
you were going to say it.

423
00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.669
The gazelles!

424
00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:04.040
They're stampeding straight
for the ostriches
and their nest!

425
00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.710
Bad day to be
an ostrich egg.

426
00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:08.000
Your Majesty,
what do we do?

427
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.330
You have to stop
the gazelles.

428
00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:10.750
And leave you here?

429
00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:12.670
I'll be fine.
You need to hurry.

430
00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:14.379

00:18:14.379 --> 00:18:16.289

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:22.580
Whew!
Thanks, Fuli.

435
00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.380
Thank Ono.
He saw the boulder.

436
00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.249
We all try to do
what we do best.

437
00:18:26.249 --> 00:18:28.079
That's why we're
a great team.

438
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.290
That is why, isn't it?

439
00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:32.380
We can't leave Simba here.
It's not safe.

440
00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.580
But he told us to go
after the gazelles.

441
00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:36.120
Lion Guard!

442
00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:39.120
All day I've been telling
you to follow me,
and do what I do.

443
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:42.000
But that's not how
your team works.

444
00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.380
So tell me.

445
00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:47.920
If I were Kion,
how would you handle this?

446
00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.119
FULI: We'd split up.

447
00:18:49.119 --> 00:18:50.669
Ono and I would go
after the herd.

448
00:18:50.669 --> 00:18:52.999
Beshte and Bunga
would stay to free you.

449
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.460
Then those are my orders.

450
00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:56.880
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

451
00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.120
There's one more thing
Kion would do.

452
00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:00.289
Right?

453
00:19:01.959 --> 00:19:03.999

be soft and soothing.

please slow down.

What's that, Ono?
Can't hear you.

471
00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:48.330
(CLEARS THROAT)
I said...

472
00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:51.079
Whoa! Everybody,
I can't hear Ono.

00:19:51.079 --> 00:19:53.039
Quiet! Stop!

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.290
Now, what were
you saying, Ono?

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:01.579
Uh, never mind.

How'd you calm the ostriches?

478
00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:10.040
Soft and soothing.

479
00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.420

out of there in no time.

Nice job, guys.

496
00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:57.290
Simba's safe, and so are
the gazelles and ostriches.

497
00:20:57.290 --> 00:20:59.830
That's because
you did it your way.

498
00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:01.499
Kion would be proud of you.

499
00:21:01.499 --> 00:21:03.329
And so am I.

500
00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:09.290
So, everyone,
how was your journey?

501
00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:11.540
Did you find Udugu?

502
00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:12.749
We found it.

503
00:21:12.749 --> 00:21:14.209
But it's not really
a place.

504
00:21:14.209 --> 00:21:17.249
It's about us working together
as brother and sister.

505
00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:18.790
As a team.

506
00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:22.290
How did things go
with the Guard?

507
00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:24.290
Well, in a way,

508
00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:27.329
the Guard helped me
find Udugu, too.

509
00:21:27.329 --> 00:21:28.879
It's an important lesson.

510
00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.250
It is,
especially for you two.

511
00:21:36.289 --> 00:21:38.209
And as Queen
of the Pride Lands

512
00:21:38.209 --> 00:21:40.209
and leader
of the Lion Guard,

513
00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:43.880
someday you will be
responsible for all of this.

514
00:21:50.289 --> 00:21:52.499
So hold on to what
you learned today.

515
00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:55.670
Then you'll always
have Udugu.
