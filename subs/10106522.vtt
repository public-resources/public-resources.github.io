(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

2
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.500
(ROARS)

3
00:00:58.419 --> 00:00:59.919
(NARRATOR READING)

4
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.960
(KION READING)

5
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.790
Careful with that branch!

6
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.120
Remember, it represents peace!

7
00:01:17.871 --> 00:01:20.711
Put the mango for
the Peace Paint with
the rest of the fruit.

8
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.420
And will someone please
make sure that the rocks
are clear of dirt?

9
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.420
Quite an operation.
Totally!

10
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.500
What do the elephants
call this ceremony again?

11
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.580
<i>Kuba... Kubamusho?</i>

12
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.079
<i>Ukumbusho.</i>

13
00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.959
It's a performance
that celebrates
the friendship

14
00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:39.581
between the elephants
and the lions
of the Pride Lands.

15
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.880
MAKINI:
'Scuse me, Lion Guard.
Comin' through.

16
00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.210
Sorry I'm late, Ma Tembo.

17
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.360
Makini, you're here.

18
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.460
Rafiki just told me I'll be
painting the elephants
for the <i>Ukumbusho.</i>

19
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.500
It's so exciting!

20
00:01:51.541 --> 00:01:55.461
Yes, and we've gathered
plenty of fruit for you
to make the Peace Paint.

21
00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.670
Oh, thank you, Ma Tembo!

22
00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:59.919
I'll get to work
making the paint
right now!

23
00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:01.539
Looking good, Ma Tembo.

24
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.000
I hope so.

25
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.960
When I was little, we had
the <i>Ukumbusho</i> every year.

26
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.600
So many wonderful memories.

27
00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:12.500
And now that we have
a new Lion Guard to play
the original Lion Guard,

28
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.380
the tradition can continue.

29
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.210
Are you all ready
for your parts?

30
00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.210
Absolutely.

31
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.920
Right, guys?

32
00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:21.999
Totally.
Affirmative.

33
00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:22.999
Okay.

34
00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:25.499
Excellent. You can
practice over there.

35
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.750
Beshte! Beshte!
Guess what!

36
00:02:28.121 --> 00:02:31.501
Me and my mom are gonna be
in the <i>Ukumbuso</i> performance
tonight, too.

37
00:02:31.591 --> 00:02:35.081
She gets to be
the bravest elephant
and I get to be the strongest.

38
00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:38.249
<i>Poa</i> , Mtoto.
I'm sure you'll be great.

39
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.250
Oh, they're all
so beautiful...

40
00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.170
Makini, we need
to get painted. Soon!

41
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.039
The show starts
at moonrise.

42
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.870
Yes. But which color
is the right color
to make first?

43
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.250
Orange? Green? Yellow?

44
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.540
Oh...

45
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.250
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
<i>Schwari.</i>

46
00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.749
If there's
no right place
to start,

47
00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:01.119
then there's
no wrong place
to start.

48
00:03:02.161 --> 00:03:05.291
(DEEPLY) Can't elephants
and lions live
together in peace?

49
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.080
I said...

50
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.920
"Can't elephants
and lions live
together in peace?"

51
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.250
And you say...

52
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.040
I know. I know.

53
00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:19.371
Of course, we can.
We are both noble animals
who believe in peace.

54
00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.669
I think it's more
about getting the feeling.

55
00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:23.909
Should I do it faster?

56
00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:28.541
Not exactly how
I remember the <i>Ukumbusho
</i> of my youth.

57
00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:30.500
I know it seems
kinda rough now...

58
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.620
Which is why
we're here.

59
00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.370
Oh, we came
as soon as we heard
the <i>Ukumbusho</i> was back on!

60
00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.040
Theatrics are our specialty!

61
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.880
Nobody does drama like Timon!

62
00:03:44.421 --> 00:03:48.121
Honestly, Ma Tembo, I don't
know why you didn't ask us
to help in the first place.

63
00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.669
I think I know why...

64
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.210
But right now,
I'll take all the help
I can get.

65
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.500
All right,
Lion Guard, listen up.

66
00:03:56.541 --> 00:04:00.211
You may be
good at stopping rock slides
and vicious predators.

67
00:04:00.211 --> 00:04:02.829
But this is serious.

68
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.250
Do ya hear me?

69
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.460
Oh, no.

70
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.210
I can't believe
I didn't think of this.

71
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:08.960
Think of what, Ma Tembo?

72
00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.079
It's just been so long
since we've had an <i>Ukumbusho.</i>

73
00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:14.879
Naturally we can't
celebrate peace
with the lions

74
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.330
without the Lion Guard.

75
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.830
Lucky for you,
the Lion Guard's here.

76
00:04:19.121 --> 00:04:23.371
And even luckier,
we're an un-Bunga-lievable
Lion Guard!

77
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.790
Yes, well... Traditionally,
the Lion Guard
in the <i>Ukumbusho</i>

78
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.170
has always been... Lions.

79
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.710
Traditionally.

80
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.580
Nothing we can do about that.

81
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.579
Yeah, tradition or not.
You can't make us lions.

82
00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.710
Ooh. I know.

83
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.830
I can paint you
to look like lions.

84
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.460
It will look amazing.

85
00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.080
Just a little paint here...

86
00:04:45.459 --> 00:04:47.249
I already look like a lion.

87
00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:48.379
(GIGGLES)

88
00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:49.709
Oh, right.

89
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:50.920
Because you are a lion.

90
00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.580
So, I'll make
the rest of you
look amazing!

91
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:54.830
Very well.

92
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.420
Whatever it takes to get us
closer to tradition.

93
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.500
Just be sure you have time
to paint the sunbursts
on the elephants, Makini.

94
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.790
The performance
won't look right without them.

95
00:05:03.831 --> 00:05:08.041
This is King Simba's
first <i>Ukumbusho,
</i> so it has to be perfect.

96
00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:10.620
Oh, yes, Ma Tembo.
I totally understand.

97
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.379
And don't worry
about the Lion Guard.

98
00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:17.251
We'll have them looking
and acting like lions
in no time!

99
00:05:17.251 --> 00:05:19.750
PUMBAA: You'll never
know the difference.

100
00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.210
So, Kion?

101
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.330
Do they look
like lions to you?

102
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:29.960
Uh...

103
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.960
Yeah, c'mon, Kion.
Do we look great?

104
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.750
Or really great?

105
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.079
I've definitely
never seen
anything like it.

106
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.500
That's what I thought.

107
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.290
I look un-Bunga-lievable.

108
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:41.750
That's one way
of putting it.

109
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.330
Prepare yourselves
for the piece de resistance!

110
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:47.209
BOTH: Ta-da!

111
00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:49.579
You see
any cheetahs here, Pumbaa?

112
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.080
Not me!

113
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.580
All I see is a lion.

114
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.210
And what a lion!

115
00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.000
I look ridiculous.
Shh...

116
00:05:58.329 --> 00:05:59.959
You're spoiling the illusion.

117
00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.670
Ooh. Ooh.
What are you doing?

118
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.330
Sorry. Even as a lion,
your fur is still so soft...

119
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:11.330
Ugh! This costume is so weird!

120
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:12.459
Come on, Fuli.

121
00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:14.169
You look just like
the rest of us.

122
00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:16.250
Why doesn't that
make me feel better?

123
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.790
You know what?
You all look terrific.

124
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.080
Good work, Makini.

125
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.160
I know you're all
gonna do great
at the <i>Ukumbusho</i> tonight.

126
00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:25.499
Oh, it's almost sunset.

127
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.460
And I still have to
paint the elephants!

128
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.120
From the top, everybody.

129
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.460
Pumbaa, you be Ma Tembo.

130
00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.580
Oh, good! Let me
get into character.

131
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.209
(TRUMPETING)

132
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.580
No, that's not right.
Let me try again.

133
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.380
(TRUMPETING)

134
00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:44.120
Beautiful, Pumbaa! Beautiful!

135
00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.380
Now, Kion...

136
00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:47.379
You say your first lines to him.

137
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.710
And remember,
looking like lions
is only part of the magic.

138
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.500
Now, we gotta get you
acting like lions.

139
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.250
I know! We can go on a hunt!

140
00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.580
Hunting does not a lion make.

141
00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:59.459
How would you know?

142
00:06:59.459 --> 00:07:02.079
We raised a lion.

143
00:07:02.461 --> 00:07:07.331
Right. Trust me, we know more
about lions than anyone else
in the Pride Lands!

144
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.750
I think I might know
a little more...

145
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.169
First thing you gotta do

146
00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:13.499
is strut around
like you own the place.

147
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.420
Ugh! That's not right...
Kion, shh!

148
00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.210
Oh, yeah. I got this!

149
00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.960
(ROARS)

150
00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.290
That's one impressive roar.

151
00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:23.209
Are you new
to the Pride Lands, lion?

152
00:07:23.499 --> 00:07:25.459
Kion, it's me, Bunga.

153
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.330
I must be really good at this.

154
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.880
(SIGHS)

155
00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.540
You're going
to love it, Zito!

156
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.920
This yellow sunburst
is going to be so pretty...

157
00:07:35.459 --> 00:07:37.539
Just as soon as I,

158
00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:38.540
uh...

159
00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:42.330
Uh-oh. Yellow...
Yellow...

160
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:44.580
There's got to be
something yellow.

161
00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:46.620
Makini, what's going on?

162
00:07:47.169 --> 00:07:48.329
Well...

163
00:07:48.579 --> 00:07:51.209
It looks like I might have
run out of yellow paint.

164
00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:52.880
In the middle of my sunburst?

165
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.830
I did have to use
a lot of yellow

166
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:56.420
to make the Lion Guard
look like lions.

167
00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.170
Do you have any idea
how preposterous that sounds?

168
00:08:00.459 --> 00:08:03.039
The <i>Ukumbusho</i> will be ruined!

169
00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:04.920
Ruined?
What's happening?

170
00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.330
What's going on?

171
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.040
Well, Makini here
wasted all her yellow paint

172
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.830
on the Lion Guard
and now there's none left
for our sunbursts.

173
00:08:13.289 --> 00:08:15.169
Do you really
need a sunburst?

174
00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:19.460
What? You lions
don't appreciate tradition
at all!

175
00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.500
Kion, sunbursts represent
the Circle of Life.

176
00:08:23.079 --> 00:08:24.669
They're a big part
of the tradition.

177
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:28.710
Or maybe you expect me
to go out there
with only half a sunburst!

178
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:30.750
I don't even have
half a sunburst

179
00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:32.790
and I still have to rehearse
my scene with Bunga.

180
00:08:32.831 --> 00:08:37.081
That scene is the centerpiece
of the entire
<i>Ukumbusho</i> performance.

181
00:08:37.081 --> 00:08:39.539
Oh, no! I really
have ruined everything!

182
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.670
You certainly have.

183
00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:43.880
Hey, we're going to
figure this out.

184
00:08:44.501 --> 00:08:47.331
We won't let
some yellow paint
ruin the <i>Ukumbusho.</i>

185
00:08:47.331 --> 00:08:49.879
What do you know about...
Listen to him, Zito.

186
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:52.290
The Guard has always
come through for us.

187
00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:54.620
What if she made
more yellow paint?

188
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.790
Okay... Makini,

189
00:08:56.831 --> 00:08:59.961
see if you can find
some more yellow fruit
in the forest.

190
00:08:59.961 --> 00:09:00.999
Fruit. Got it.

191
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:04.120
Okay. Good.
In the meantime...

192
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:07.080
Mtoto's mom,
you go rehearse with Bunga.

193
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.080
Don't worry, Ma Tembo.
Everything's gonna be okay.

194
00:09:11.499 --> 00:09:13.119
Nope. No. Oh!

195
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:17.540
Ooh, beautiful! No.
Yellow, Makini. Yellow!

196
00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:19.880
<i>Schwari...</i>

197
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:21.960
(GASPS)

198
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.169
Ohhh...

199
00:09:23.169 --> 00:09:24.919
I can crush these
and make paint

200
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.620
that's even more beautiful
than the banana paint
I had before!

201
00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:30.960
'Scuse me, bees.
I really need these flowers!

202
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:33.710
I have yellow!

203
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:35.419
Oh, thank the Savannah.

204
00:09:35.419 --> 00:09:36.579
Good going, Makini.

205
00:09:36.879 --> 00:09:38.709
About time.

206
00:09:38.751 --> 00:09:42.121
Don't you think these flowers
will make an even
prettier yellow paint?

207
00:09:42.121 --> 00:09:44.670
Just finish painting me.

208
00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.330
Don't tell me, don't tell me.
I'll remember...

209
00:09:48.419 --> 00:09:49.619
Uh... Line?

210
00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.000
(SIGHS)
"We bravest can do anything."

211
00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:55.380
Of course we can.
What's my line?

212
00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:57.170
That is your line.

213
00:09:57.749 --> 00:09:59.749
"We bravest can do anything."

214
00:09:59.749 --> 00:10:00.789
Then my mom says,

215
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.581
"We bravest can even
find peace when things
are most frightening."

216
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.000
Got it. It's all in my head.
If I could find my head.

217
00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.210
But I'll
get my lines eventually.

218
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:15.750
Okay, Kion.
After Ma Tembo passes
the Branch of Peace to you,

219
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.120
you pass it
to the fastest lion...

220
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.620
Here. Go.

221
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:20.710
(MUFFLED) With this branch,

222
00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:22.710
we will hasten
the day of peace.

223
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:24.749
I can't understand her at all.

224
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:26.540
(MUFFLED)
That's because I have
a stick in my mouth.

225
00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:28.380
(CLEARS THROAT)

226
00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.040
Here. Strongest. Go!

227
00:10:31.791 --> 00:10:34.501
(MUFFLED)
It takes great strength to
support peace between us.

228
00:10:34.501 --> 00:10:35.789
Couldn't
understand that either.

229
00:10:36.499 --> 00:10:39.749
It's the stick.
It's ruining everything!

230
00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.580
Oh! Oh! I know!
Kion!

231
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.460
When the elephant tries to
give you the Branch of Peace,

232
00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:50.289
just say, "No thanks!"

233
00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:52.380
Brilliant! That solves it!

234
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:53.790
No, it doesn't.

235
00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.120
The whole performance
is about peace.

236
00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:59.040
Oh, fine.
Don't take my advice.

237
00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.709
If you wanna go out there
and flop, be my guest!

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:05.420
Everyone!
The King is here!

Take your places.
It's time to start the show!

241
00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:10.710
But I still don't have
my peace paint on yet!

242
00:11:11.169 --> 00:11:13.169
I got ya!
I just did four of these,

243
00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:16.460
I can practically
paint a sunburst
with my eyes closed.

244
00:11:16.831 --> 00:11:19.961
Ma Tembo, I am
looking forward to
this evening's celebration.

245
00:11:19.961 --> 00:11:23.751
I'll be interested to see
if the <i>Ukumbusho</i> is
as beautiful as I've heard.

246
00:11:23.751 --> 00:11:26.749
Yes, Your Majesty.
We shall see.

247
00:11:35.079 --> 00:11:36.289
Everybody ready?

248
00:11:36.289 --> 00:11:37.459

the lions and elephants made
the Pride Lands

I am first leader

You have
nothing to fear from us.

Hmm. That's strange.

293
00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:59.920
Is this because
I didn't know my lines?

I'm not sure
what's going on.

295

But elephants on a rampage
could hurt someone!

296
00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:05.960
Or themselves!

297
00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:07.580
C'mon. We gotta stop 'em.

Elephants!
Calm down!

303
00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:33.830
Why are the elephants
so scared?

304
00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:36.170
Well, elephants
are afraid of bees.

305
00:14:36.419 --> 00:14:38.289
But I didn't realize
they were this afraid.

306
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:40.420
Elephants are afraid of bees?

307
00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:41.830
Common knowledge, really.

308
00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:43.880
Huh. Hard to believe
that something so big

309
00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.750
can be afraid of
something so delicious.

310
00:14:46.041 --> 00:14:49.041
So how are we gonna get
rampaging elephants
to stop rampaging?

311
00:14:49.379 --> 00:14:50.959
Why don't we
ask those elephants?

312
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.330
(ALL SHOUT)

313
00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:56.290
(PANTING) Any bees on me?

314
00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:58.000
Don't see any.

315
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.620
So the bees
stopped chasing you...

316
00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:03.039
But they're still after
the other elephants.

317
00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.210
I guess so. But why?

318
00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:06.600
Hmm.

319
00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:09.921
You weren't in the show,
but Ma Tembo
and the others were.

320
00:15:09.921 --> 00:15:13.331
And they're
wearing the yellow paint
that Makini made from flowers.

321
00:15:13.331 --> 00:15:14.100
Of course!

322
00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.831
The bees are attracted
to the pollen
from the flowers!

323
00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:19.880
We have to wash that pollen
off the elephants!

324
00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:21.750
Good thinking, Kion.

325
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:23.540
Except it's the middle
of the Dry Season.

326
00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:26.620
Where are we going to find
enough water to wash
a bunch of giant elephants?

327
00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.580
ONO: We better
figure it out fast.

328
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Herd of buffalo...

329
00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:34.790
Right in the elephants' path!

330
00:15:35.289 --> 00:15:37.119
Fuli, go warn the buffalo!

331
00:15:37.119 --> 00:15:38.709
We'll stay on the elephants.

332
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:39.960

333
00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:40.960

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.920
Buffalo! You need to
get out of here!

336
00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.210
Right now!

337
00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:49.670
Leave? This is one of the
few grazing grounds left.

338
00:15:50.039 --> 00:15:52.289
Who do you think you are?
Telling us what to do!

339
00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:54.540
It's me, Fuli.
From the Lion Guard.

340
00:15:56.661 --> 00:15:59.711
The costume. Of course.
Ugh. I knew
I looked ridiculous.

341
00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:03.040
Long story. Elephants
are coming fast.
You gotta move.

342
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:05.040
And why should we
listen to you,

343
00:16:05.081 --> 00:16:08.161
weird looking
cheetah-lion thing that we've
never seen before?

344
00:16:08.161 --> 00:16:09.000
I don't have time for this.

345
00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:14.160
Hmm. (GRUFFLY)
Because I am something
you've never seen before.

346
00:16:14.499 --> 00:16:16.579
I only come out

on the paint.

it's not tradition,

but maybe we should consider
finishing the <i>Ukumbusho
