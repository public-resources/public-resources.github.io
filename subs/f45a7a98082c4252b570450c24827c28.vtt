I can't see Bunga.
Why is he pretty?

You wouldn't
believe it

I don't know what they are,
but they sure are cute.

I've never seen one,
but they fit that description.

71
00:04:06.331 --> 00:04:08.750
But red pandas
are solitary animals.

72
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.920

a whole pack of them.

has he been "chosen" to do?
