00:01:06.371 --> 00:01:12.371
<i>Poa!</i> Nothing better than
the feel of squishy mud
under your feet.

6
00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:16.210
Except maybe the feel
of no mud under your feet.

7
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.330
After last night's
big storm,

8
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.420
I'm glad the mud
is our only problem.

9
00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:24.209
That's what he thinks!

10
00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:27.119
Everything's going
exactly as planned.

11
00:01:27.161 --> 00:01:30.211
You mean you planned
for the Lion Guard
to be here?

12
00:01:30.211 --> 00:01:34.120
No! I planned to go after
those wildebeests.

13
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.169
With all this mud,
they'll never outrun us.

14
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.540
Wait. You planned
on the mud?

15
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.380
(GASPS) Did you
make it rain?

16
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.120
No, fur-brain! Look.

17
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.500
We just gotta wait
for the Lion Guard
to clear out...

18
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.120
And now it's lunchtime.
C'mon, fellas!

Well, look who it is.
The Lion Guard!

24
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.290
What are you guys doin'
in the Outlands?

25
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.169
Nice try, Janja.

26
00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:14.459
We both know this is
the Pride Lands.

27
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.380
And you don't belong here.

28
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.540
Yeah, yeah...

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.540

30
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.250
That was fun!

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.169
C'mon, fellas, let's go.

32
00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:26.289
It's too muddy
around here, anyway.

33
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.330
But, Janja, I thought
you liked the mud!

34
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.500
Yeah! 'Cause it slows down
the wilde... The wilde...

35
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.209
Wildebeests?

36
00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.579
Yeah! Them!

37
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.500
We was gonna have 'em
for lunch!

38
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.620
Fur-brains! Shh!

39
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.500
The mud might slow down
the wildebeests.

40
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.329
But I don't think
it's gonna slow you down.

Get off of me, fur-brains!

45
00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.249
Another plan ruined!
And do you know why?

46
00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:02.249
'Cause you
slipped on the mud?

47
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.580
And slided into
the Lion Guard?

48
00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.670
No! It's because of you two!

49
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.420
BOTH: Us?

50
00:03:08.461 --> 00:03:11.421
That's right!
Every time I come up
with a brilliant plan,

51
00:03:11.421 --> 00:03:12.619
you two mess it up!

52
00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.210
We do?

53
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.290
Uh... I thought we
messed it up together.

54
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.380
(LAUGHS) Yeah!
We're great at that!

55
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.380
(GROANS) You know what?
I can't take it anymore.

56
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.209
You're both fired!

57
00:03:27.541 --> 00:03:32.291
Weren't you two
fur-brains listening?
I said you're fired!

58
00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:33.380
We're on fire?

59
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.459
(SNIFFS)
Ahhh!

60
00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.379
I don't even smell smoke!

61
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.380
You're not "on fire."
You are fired!

62
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.620
It means you're finished.
You're done. You're through.

63
00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.500
I don't need ya!

64
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.210
(CHUCKLING) Of course,
you don't need us!

65
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.419
(LAUGHING) Yeah! Yo,
what's the new plan?

66
00:03:50.461 --> 00:03:53.331
There ain't no new plan!
You're not in
the crew anymore!

67
00:03:53.331 --> 00:03:55.580
Get out of the Outlands!

68
00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.500
You two, I'm giving you
a promotion.

69
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.289
Okay.
Thanks.

70
00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:01.749
And here's your first job...

71
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.460
Get rid of those two
fur-brains!

72
00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.670

(BOTH GROWLING)

75
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.710

Uh, sure! No problem!

77
00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.499
Yeah. We're lost most
of the time already!

(SNARLING)

79
00:04:19.541 --> 00:04:23.371
Remind me again,
why are we slogging
through all this mud?

80
00:04:23.371 --> 00:04:24.709
We gotta make sure
all the trails

81
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.540
in the Pride Lands are safe
after the big rainstorm.

82
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.420

Uh-oh.

83
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.290

includes this one!

Hyah!

87
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.420
Okay. So this trail
isn't safe.

88
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.500
But this is the main path
from Big Springs
to Mekundu Cliffs.

89
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.709
Everyone uses it!

90
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.540
So we'll need to clear it
and make it safe again.

91
00:04:52.581 --> 00:04:56.421
Ono, Bunga.
Keep everyone off this
trail till we're done.

92
00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:57.710
Affirmative!

93
00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.379
You got it, Kion!

94
00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:02.329
Fuli, Beshte.
You're with me.

95
00:05:02.371 --> 00:05:04.751
We have to get all these
trees and boulders
off this trail.

96
00:05:04.751 --> 00:05:05.790
Sure thing!

97
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.540
Well, if I have
to get muddy,

98
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.620
might as well do it
for a good cause!

99
00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:13.579
That's the spirit, Fuli!

100
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.710
JANJA: All right,
you twos, listen up.

101
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.500
Now that you're my
seconds-in-command,

102
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.380
you gotta learn the rules.

103
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.669
Rule number one,
I am the smartest
hyena around!

104
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:26.750
Rule number three...

105
00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.420
What about
rule number two?

106
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.580
What about it?
What is it?

108
00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.670
Forget the rules!

109
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.660
The main thing is,
I come up with the plans,
and you guys...

110
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.670
Actually, Janja,
we already have a plan.

111
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.420
What? Didn't I just tell you
I'm the one who...

112
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:44.750
It's an awesome plan!

113
00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.380
How awesome?

114
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.829
Okay, this is a herd
of antelopes.

115
00:05:48.829 --> 00:05:51.669
(LAUGHS) No, it's not!
It's a bone!

116
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.540
Shh!

117
00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.420
First, we stampede them
in this direction.
Right.

118
00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.790
And then the Lion Guard
comes in and runs off
after the antelopes.

119
00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.749
Oh, I get it! And then
we come home hungry!

120
00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.710
That sounds like
one of my plans!

121
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:06.880
No, see?

122
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.460
After they run off,
we find a herd of oryxes.

123
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.829
Wait, those are oryxes?

124
00:06:11.829 --> 00:06:14.789
And we chase them
in a different direction!

125
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:16.880
Then we catch
the oryxes over here,

126
00:06:16.921 --> 00:06:20.711
while the Lion Guard's
still busy with the
antelopes over there!

127
00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:23.419
Uh-huh.

128
00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:24.539
Uh, well, good plan.

129
00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:25.789
Yeah! Finally.

130
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:27.790
Hyenas who got
smarts like me.

131
00:06:27.831 --> 00:06:30.661
Those other fur-brains
never knew what
they were doing.

132
00:06:30.661 --> 00:06:32.710
Just like some other
hyenas we know.

133
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.790
Right.
(LAUGHING)

134
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:39.710
Still not sure why
we're givin' up a nice,
juicy bone for a rock.

ONO: Excuse me!

136
00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.580
Oh, goodness!

137
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.750
Sorry, didn't mean
to startle you.

138
00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:47.539
You might not
want to go this way.

139
00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:49.499
But I have to
get to Big Springs.

140
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.420
Oh, gotta go around!

141
00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.830
Big mudslide up ahead.

142
00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.540
It's a mess!

143
00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.670
Oh, I see what you mean.

144
00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:57.750
Thanks for the heads-up.

145
00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.749
(LAUGHING)

146
00:06:59.749 --> 00:07:02.669
"Heads-up." Good one.

147
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:03.920
You're a giraffe.

148
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.580
Your head couldn't
get more up!

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:07.750

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.710
Um...
Don't mind him.

Ooh!

152
00:07:12.579 --> 00:07:14.749
Wait till Beshte
hears that one.

(CANTERING)

154
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.830
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

155
00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:18.920
Slow down there.

156
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.750
Hello? I'm trying
to get through.

157
00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.539
Step aside.

158
00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.960
You don't understand.
There's a mudslide
up ahead and...

159
00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.830
You don't understand.
You're in my way!

160
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:31.540
Well, we tried.

161
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:32.670
Maybe he'll get
through okay.

ZEBRA: Excuse me!

163
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.539
Or maybe not.

164
00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:38.499
A little help here?

still chasing us?

Nuh-uh.

168
00:07:47.619 --> 00:07:51.499
Hey! I don't think we're
in the Outlands anymore.

169
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.920
Oh, yeah!

170
00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.580
Ooh. We're in
the Pride Lands!

(GASPS)

172
00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:01.709
That means we did what
Janja told us to do!

173
00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:03.830
You think we should
go back and tell him?

174
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:05.620
(LAUGHING) Yeah, yeah!

175
00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:06.830
(GASPS) No, wait.

176
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:09.620
He said we ain't
in his crew no more.

call us fur-brains?

Well...

Hey, Big B!
Wait till you hear
what the giraffe said

when we told her
about the mudslide!

Maybe he's gonna let us
back into the Outlands!

Janja kicked us
outta the Outlands.

We ain't on
his crew no more.

messed things up!

But we can't go back!

But what if they chase
after the herds
like Janja always does?

297
00:12:53.211 --> 00:12:55.960
Why would we do that?

lying all over the place?

300
00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:04.120

let them stay.

After all,
hyenas are scavengers.

By cleaning up
after everyone,

303
00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.000

be helping

in the Pride Lands.

305
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.959
Hmm. Maybe you're right, Ono.

306
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.040
And I guess letting them stay
would be the nice thing to do.

307
00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:19.040
Feels weird, though.

308
00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:22.960
Okay. As long as you two
don't cause any trouble,

309
00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.209
you can stay
in the Pride Lands.

every once in a while.

one of Janja's plans.

I like it!

00:15:32.461 --> 00:15:34.380
We scared off
the antelopes

355
00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:37.250
so the Lion Guard
will chase after them.

356
00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:38.999
While they're busy,

357
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.960
we're gonna go after
something else.

358
00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.420
In the opposite direction.

359
00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:48.040
So... The antelopes
aren't dinner?

360
00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.329
No!

361
00:15:49.329 --> 00:15:51.419
Oh, but I like antelope.

362
00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:53.080
That's dinner.

363
00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:57.380
Ooh! Oryxes!
They're good, too!

364
00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:59.080
Come on, fur-brain!

365
00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.289
What'd you call me?

366
00:16:00.289 --> 00:16:03.289
Oh, sorry... Boss.

367
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:05.290
That's better. I...
(BOTH LAUGHING)

368
00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:08.290
Hey! Wait for me!
I'm your leader,
remember?

369
00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:12.290
Slow it down.
No need to run.

370
00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:14.249
The Lion Guard's here to help.

371
00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:18.080
Yeah, but help them
with what?

372
00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.040
Good question, Little B.

373
00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.380
I never did see
anyone chasing them.

374
00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.460
Me neither.

375
00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.330
You said earlier
you've got an idea
what started the stampede.

376
00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:28.289
Yeah. It's all our fault.

377
00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:30.290
What?
How could it be our fault?

378
00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:32.250
I'd never start
a stampede.

379
00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:34.250
We didn't start
the stampede.

380
00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:37.290
But we let Cheezi and Chungu
stay in the Pride Lands.

381
00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:39.249
You think
they had something
to do with it?

382
00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:41.120
Either them or Janja.

383
00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.080
I caught the scent
of hyenas earlier.

384
00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.210
Ono, find Cheezi and Chungu
and lead us to 'em.

385
00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:47.250
On it!

386
00:16:48.379 --> 00:16:50.289
(BOTH SNORING)

387
00:16:50.289 --> 00:16:52.079
(RUMBLING)

388
00:17:01.379 --> 00:17:03.169
You two fur-brains!

389
00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:05.330
Janja!
Is it really you?

390
00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:07.080
Did you come
looking for us?

391
00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.460
Do you want us back?

392
00:17:08.501 --> 00:17:13.121
You kidding?
I got two new hyenas
that do everything I say.

393
00:17:13.121 --> 00:17:15.119
They really respect me.

394
00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:17.040
TANO: Janja!

395
00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.330
You coming?
Just let him stay behind.

396
00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:22.420
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

397
00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:23.460
See what I mean?

398
00:17:24.459 --> 00:17:26.039
Fellas! Wait up!

399
00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:29.460
Did... Did that
really just happen?

400
00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.540
Maybe it was
just a dream.

401
00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:33.380
Yeah, yeah.

402
00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:36.330
I'm gonna dream
about Janja some more.

403
00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:37.459
Me, too.

404
00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.420
There's a dead-end
canyon up ahead!

405
00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:46.500
We can trap them there

406
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.460
before the Lion Guard
gets back

407
00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:50.419
from their wild goose chase.

408
00:17:50.419 --> 00:17:51.499
JANJA: Wild goose?

409
00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.250
I thought they were
chasing antelopes.

410
00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:54.420
I thought
we dumped you.

411
00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:56.500
You can't dump me.
I'm the boss.

412
00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.380
Oh, yeah?
Watch us.

413
00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:04.420
(GROANS)

414
00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.250
NNE: So long...

415
00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:07.500
Fur-brain!

416
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.330
(LAUGHING)

417

(BOTH CONTINUE SNORING)

418
00:18:14.499 --> 00:18:17.459
You still think they started
the antelope stampede?

419
00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.580
Let's ask 'em.

420
00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:20.420
Hey!
(BOTH GASP)

421
00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:21.540
Okay, you two.

422
00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.540
Why'd you start
that stampede?

423
00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:25.209
Stampede?

424
00:18:25.209 --> 00:18:26.539
It wasn't us!

425
00:18:26.539 --> 00:18:29.579
We was busy
dreamin' about Janja!

426
00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:31.580
Yeah, yeah!

427
00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.420
Maybe it was
Dream Janja
that did it!

428
00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.290
"Dream Janja"?

429
00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:38.499
JANJA: Nne! Tano!
Come back here!

430
00:18:38.499 --> 00:18:41.079
That sounds like
the real Janja to me.

431
00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.500
I knew it!
Come on!

432
00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.620
Janja's really here?

433
00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:49.539
It's a dream come true!

434
00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:53.250
Those double-crossing
no-goods!

435
00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:57.290
Oh, great.

436
00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:59.620
Just when I thought
it couldn't get any worse.

437
00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:02.249
Why'd you scare off
the antelopes, Janja?

438
00:19:02.249 --> 00:19:03.539
What's your plan?

439
00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.420
Bad enough I get
pushed off a cliff.

440
00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:07.330
I ain't gonna take
the blame, too.

441
00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:09.580
It was their idea!
The new guys!

442
00:19:09.621 --> 00:19:14.541
Something about getting
you to chase the antelopes
while we chase the oryxes!

443
00:19:14.541 --> 00:19:16.419
Sounds like a
pretty good plan.

444
00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:17.460
Ono!

445
00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.420
ONO: (GASPS) <i>Hapana!
</i> I see them!

446
00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:27.249
They're chasing the oryxes
into a dead-end canyon!

447
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.580
Lion Guard!

448
00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:31.210
Let's go!

449
00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:32.500
JANJA: Hey, hey, wait,
where are you going?

450
00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.500
You're just gonna
leave me here?

451
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.330
Don't worry, Janja!

452
00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:37.499
We won't leave you.

supposed to save me?

Save you? (LAUGHS)

457
00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:50.289
We weren't trying
to save you.

00:19:50.289 --> 00:19:51.379
Yeah!

459
00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:53.580
We just wanna
keep you company.

Oh, whatcha
staring at, oryxes?

464
00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:11.420
NNE: Never seen
smart hyenas before?

465
00:20:12.379 --> 00:20:13.579
They still haven't!

Don't tell me.

469
00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:22.250
The Lion Guard.

470
00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:24.620
And you must be
Janja's new crew.

471
00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:26.539
We're our own crew.

472
00:20:26.539 --> 00:20:28.249
So now what?

473
00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:31.710
You gonna
scare us off
with the Roar?

474
00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:33.460
You are pretty smart.

479
00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.420
So, what about Janja?

480
00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:58.330
Can't we just leave
him on the ledge?

481
00:20:58.330 --> 00:20:59.460
I wish.

482
00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:01.379
But we gotta get him
off the ledge

483
00:21:01.379 --> 00:21:03.289
and out of the Pride Lands.

484
00:21:03.289 --> 00:21:04.539
BESHTE: Hmm.

485
00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:06.250
Might not be easy.

486
00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:11.620
Uh, are we sure
this is the right cliff?

487
00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.709
Janja? Cheezi? Chungu?

488
00:21:13.709 --> 00:21:15.249
You okay?

489
00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:19.330
Uh, yeah!
I think so.

490
00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:21.710
KION: Okay, then.

491
00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:24.460
It's time for you
to go home.

492
00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.289
Fine with me.

493
00:21:26.289 --> 00:21:28.329
I've had enough of
this place for one day.

Hey, you coming?

495
00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:34.420
Sure, Janja!

496
00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:36.500
We thought
you'd never ask!

Oh! (SNARLS)

That's right, Janja.

That's what we are.

Yeah. Thanks.
