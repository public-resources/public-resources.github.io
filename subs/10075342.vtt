a creature out here that's
as tall as two giraffes

with big spikes,
and teeth sharper
than a crocodile?

don't ya, Big B?

I don't know, Bunga.
I've never seen
anything like that.

But there's probably lots
of things I've never seen.

seen everything.

We'll find whatever

it's not a Zimwi.

it was, I ran away.

You're not the Zimwi!

from two little porcupines?

something scary

Uh, yeah.

00:19:39.961 --> 00:19:43.501
Of course!
So, you huddled together
and stuck out your quills

to make yourselves
look bigger.

414
00:19:45.331 --> 00:19:49.121
Then the rhino saw you
like that and thought
you were the Zimwi!

415

And so did we.

were chasing us.

I can do it.

And you charged in anyway.

I think you can bellow in
