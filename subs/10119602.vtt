Great work, guys.

13
00:01:35.251 --> 00:01:38.880
The fire could have been
a lot worse for Ma Tembo
and the elephants.

14

Ma Tembo.
You're good to go back.

Thank you, Kion. Lion Guard.

get here sooner.

been completely burned.

sacrifice compared to
what could have been.

It's fire! From the sky!

24
00:02:08.621 --> 00:02:11.170
They must be embers
from the fire!

25
00:02:11.171 --> 00:02:12.330
I thought we put 'em all out!

26
00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:14.830

to put out those fires!

you're with Fuli
and Bunga on fire breaks.

they work this time.

as you can!

otherwise...

to stay here?

(GALAGOS SCREAMING)

343
00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.500
FULI: Just aim for my spots
and jump!

344
00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:14.170
We'll catch you,
don't worry!

345
00:18:14.171 --> 00:18:15.710
Yeah! I'm a great catcher!

346
00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.380
See? I'm good at this!

347
00:18:23.381 --> 00:18:24.580
Wanna do it again?

348
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:27.960
Kion. The fire's spreading.

349
00:18:27.961 --> 00:18:30.170
Ono and I can't put it out
fast enough.

350
00:18:30.171 --> 00:18:33.500
Indeed! I'm afraid
we might lose Ndefu Grove!

351
00:18:33.501 --> 00:18:36.710
KION: No. I'm not losing
any more of the Pride Lands.

352
00:18:36.711 --> 00:18:38.580
We just need some help.

353
00:18:38.581 --> 00:18:41.210
Keep at it guys!
Don't give up yet!

354
00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:47.000
Hooray!

355
00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:50.290
Thank you, Lion Guard.
Thank you!

356
00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:54.500
KION: Ma Tembo, please stop.
Please!

357
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:57.080
Kion. I know you want us
to stay...

358
00:18:57.081 --> 00:18:58.710
It's not about that right now.

359
00:18:58.711 --> 00:19:00.380
I need your help.

360
00:19:00.381 --> 00:19:02.380
Ndefu Grove is on fire,

361
00:19:02.381 --> 00:19:04.210
and we can't save it
on our own.

362
00:19:04.211 --> 00:19:05.540
Ndefu Grove?

363
00:19:05.541 --> 00:19:08.120
Shame there aren't any
elephants living there...

364
00:19:08.121 --> 00:19:09.540
Zito, hush!

365
00:19:09.541 --> 00:19:11.460
Zito. Ma Tembo.

366
00:19:11.461 --> 00:19:14.420
I'm so sorry the other animals
didn't take you in.

367
00:19:14.421 --> 00:19:17.460
But you're still
Pride Landers! Please.

368
00:19:17.461 --> 00:19:20.290
Help me show everyone what
that really means.

369
00:19:20.291 --> 00:19:21.420
Of course we'll help.

370
00:19:21.421 --> 00:19:22.500
We will?

371
00:19:22.501 --> 00:19:25.580
Yes Zito. The Pride Landers
are our family.

372
00:19:25.581 --> 00:19:28.380
And you don't turn your
back on them.

373
00:19:28.381 --> 00:19:30.210
Even when they make
mistakes.

374
00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:32.290
Stay with the little ones.

375
00:19:32.291 --> 00:19:34.000
Everyone else, with me!

376
00:19:34.001 --> 00:19:37.170
We'll go to Ndefu Grove by way
of Lake Kiziwa!

377
00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:39.210
Thank you, Ma Tembo.

378
00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:44.040
Don't worry about me, then!
I'm staying right here.

379
00:19:44.041 --> 00:19:46.670
With family
that appreciates elephants!

380
00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.580
Am I right?

381
00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:51.290
I'll take that as a yes.

382
00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:59.250
It's Kion! With help!

383
00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:11.210
Ready... Now!

384
00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:22.460
BUNGA: Whoa! That feels great!

385
00:20:22.461 --> 00:20:23.580
Do it again!

386
00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:31.580
Zito! You came!

387
00:20:31.581 --> 00:20:34.210
Yes, well... You don't turn
your back on family.

388
00:20:34.211 --> 00:20:36.750
Unless your back
will save them
from a falling tree.

389
00:20:36.751 --> 00:20:38.120
Thanks, Zito.

390
00:20:38.121 --> 00:20:40.380
C'mon! Let's put out
this fire.

391
00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:51.000
LAINI: Is it over?

392
00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:58.500
Thanks to the elephants,
the damage isn't bad.

393
00:20:58.501 --> 00:21:01.330
Once everything cools
down, you can go back.

394
00:21:01.331 --> 00:21:02.540
Thank you.

395
00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:05.250
And, thank you.

396
00:21:05.251 --> 00:21:07.580
You and your elephants
saved our home.

397
00:21:07.581 --> 00:21:10.000
Even after we pushed you away.

398
00:21:10.001 --> 00:21:12.500
We know how
it feels to lose a home.

399
00:21:12.501 --> 00:21:15.210
We were proud
to help save yours.

400
00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:18.420
Please live with the galagos!
We'd love to have you!

401
00:21:18.421 --> 00:21:21.040
Thank you. Your offer
is most generous.

402
00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:22.750
Isn't it Zito?

403
00:21:22.751 --> 00:21:25.080
Well, we have
to live somewhere...

404
00:21:25.081 --> 00:21:27.210
Hooray!

405
00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:32.750
I think this might actually
turn out okay.

406
00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.210
<i>Poa!</i>

407
00:21:34.211 --> 00:21:36.250
I always knew it would.

408
00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.620
Kilio Valley...

409
00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:50.960
We'll get you back home
one day, Ma Tembo. I promise.

410
00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:52.880
Thank you Kion.

411
00:21:52.881 --> 00:21:55.250
I look forward to
having our land back.

412
00:21:55.251 --> 00:21:57.080
But as for home...

413
00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:59.080
We're already here.

414
00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:04.080
