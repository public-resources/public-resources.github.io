of something else.

think of something.

the bats took either.

to see down here.

how the bats do it.

That's it!

297
00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.830
We can try to see
the same way as the bats.

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:48.920
Bats can see in the dark?

299
00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:51.460
It isn't exactly seeing.

300
00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:53.290
It's called echolocation.

Echo-lo... What again?

302
00:12:55.291 --> 00:12:56.880
Echolocation.

303
00:12:56.881 --> 00:12:59.710
The bats make a sound,
then listen for the echo.

304
00:12:59.711 --> 00:13:01.170
Depending on how loud it is,

305
00:13:01.171 --> 00:13:03.250
the bats know
which tunnel to take.

306
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.960
If it's a loud echo,
it's a dead end.

307
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:09.710
But if the echo fades away,

308
00:13:09.711 --> 00:13:12.670
then there's an opening
and that's the right tunnel.

What? It's not? Why?
Let's try again.

359
00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:34.120
The bats make
clicking noises
like I was doing,

360
00:15:34.121 --> 00:15:36.120
but they're louder
and higher-pitched,

361
00:15:36.121 --> 00:15:38.120
so they create clear echoes.

362
00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:40.670
Or maybe they can just
hear better than I can.

363
00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.210
Maybe you just
need to make

364
00:15:42.211 --> 00:15:44.000
a louder,
higher-pitched noise.

365
00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:47.330
Let's think.
Loud and high-pitched.

366
00:15:47.331 --> 00:15:49.080
Loud and high-pitched.

367
00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:50.750
What sort of noise
should it be?

368
00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:53.170
(GASPS) I know the perfect

369
00:15:53.171 --> 00:15:54.790
loud and high-pitched noise!

370
00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:57.120
You do?
What is it?

371
00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:58.920
Your voice!

372
00:15:58.921 --> 00:16:02.120
Really? You think
I'm high-pitched?

373
00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.210
You sure are!

374
00:16:04.211 --> 00:16:06.380
And loud enough
to echo?

375
00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.210
Oh, yes! I need
you to shout.

376
00:16:09.211 --> 00:16:11.420
Then we'll both listen
back for the echo!

377
00:16:11.421 --> 00:16:13.830
Oh, yes.
That sounds amazing.

378
00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:15.830
What do I shout?

379
00:16:15.831 --> 00:16:16.830
Anything.

380
00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:20.830
(SCREAMS) Anything!

381
00:16:20.831 --> 00:16:23.920
Anything! (ECHOES LOUDLY)

382
00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.170
Hmm. That echo
was pretty loud.

383
00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:31.500
That means the tunnel

384
00:16:31.501 --> 00:16:32.880
ends not very far from here.

385
00:16:32.881 --> 00:16:33.920
Try this one.

386
00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:39.290
(SCREAMS) Anything!

387
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:41.500
(ECHO CONTINUES)

388
00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:44.040
(ECHO FADES)

389
00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.880
Oh, that one
sounds different.

390
00:16:47.881 --> 00:16:50.080
It seems further away
each time it echoed.

391
00:16:50.081 --> 00:16:53.080
Exactly. Which means,
there's an opening
at the end.

392
00:16:53.081 --> 00:16:55.170
And that means,
it's our way out.

393
00:16:55.171 --> 00:16:56.170

Not another marsh light.

Nope. Regular old light
from the sky.

Good. Lead the way.

Nah, there probably aren't
any snails down there.

some under there.
