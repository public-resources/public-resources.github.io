stop talking?

No flies.

294
00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.080
Well, sure,
because we're with a zebra.

there's no flies anywhere.

301
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:28.540
It's too barren
for them out here.

302
00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.000
So, if there are no flies,

303
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.500
can we lose the zebra?

304
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.830
Yeah, we'll be
faster on our own.

305
00:13:35.999 --> 00:13:37.829
