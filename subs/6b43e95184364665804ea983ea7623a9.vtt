BESHTE: Poa.

6
00:01:08.171 --> 00:01:10.750
Sure is nice to relax
now that we're here
at the Tree of Life.

7
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.080
(SIGHS) Gotta admit.
You're right, Beshte.

8
00:01:15.081 --> 00:01:16.830
Ooh, yeah!

9
00:01:16.831 --> 00:01:18.420
Nothin' better than relaxin'

10
00:01:18.421 --> 00:01:20.540
and munchin' on bugs.
(CRUNCHING)

11
00:01:20.541 --> 00:01:23.290
Ugh. Yeah. Nothing better.

12
00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:25.080
KION: I'm glad
you guys get to relax.

13
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.170
Uh, Kion? You okay?

14
00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:32.120
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY) He's fine.
The mud is helping to treat
the venom in his scar.

15
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.120
Can I...
Yes, you can
wash it off now.

16
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.670
Ah. That's better.

17
00:01:41.671 --> 00:01:43.080
So how's
the healing going?

18
00:01:43.081 --> 00:01:44.880
Kion is making progress.

19
00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:47.000
But we still have
a long way to go.

20
00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:49.670
Right. Long way to go.

21
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.500
Speaking of healing,

22
00:01:51.501 --> 00:01:54.120
Ono, it is time
for your healing to begin.

23
00:01:54.121 --> 00:01:56.790
Oh. Yes, yes, yes!

24
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.750
Your remedy is ready.

25
00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:01.170
Queen Janna and Makini
are waiting for you.

26
00:02:01.171 --> 00:02:03.080
Shall we go
to the Tree of Life?

27
00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:04.210
You... You mean
right now?

28
00:02:04.211 --> 00:02:06.000
Of course. Let's go!

29
00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:07.170
Good luck, Ono!

30
00:02:07.171 --> 00:02:09.330
Yeah, good...
Ooh, water bugs!

31
00:02:09.331 --> 00:02:12.500
They're better than
regular bugs 'cause
they're a lot crunchier.

32
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.460
Ugh! Bunga! Could you be
any noisier when you eat?

33
00:02:16.461 --> 00:02:18.580
I can try. Like this?

34
00:02:18.581 --> 00:02:19.750
(CHOMPING LOUDLY)

35
00:02:19.751 --> 00:02:22.710
I think Bunga's chewing
is kinda quiet
for a honey badger.

36
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.790
(MUFFLED) You know
other honey badgers?

37
00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.750
Sure. My friend Binga.

38
00:02:26.751 --> 00:02:28.250
She lives just over there
in the marshes.

39
00:02:28.251 --> 00:02:30.540
Ooh, I've never met
another honey badger.

40
00:02:30.541 --> 00:02:31.620
I gotta meet her!

41
00:02:31.621 --> 00:02:33.120
Okay. Let's go.

<i>Zuka Zama!</i>

43
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.250
Huh. Another
honey badger.

44
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.830
Sounds nice.

45
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.330
Sounds stinky.

(BINGA CHOMPING)

47
00:02:43.881 --> 00:02:45.790
Yep. That'd be Binga.

48
00:02:45.791 --> 00:02:47.670
Wow. She does chew loud.

49
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.420

51
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.120
Whoa! You're
a honey badger.

52
00:02:56.121 --> 00:02:57.790
You're a honey badger!

53
00:02:57.791 --> 00:03:00.000
BOTH: We're honey badgers!

54
00:03:00.001 --> 00:03:02.830
Bunga, meet Binga.
Binga, Bunga.

55
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:04.620
BOTH: Bunga! Binga!
Bunga! Binga!

56
00:03:04.621 --> 00:03:06.500
Bug eating contest,
Bunga?

57
00:03:06.501 --> 00:03:08.000
You're on, Binga.

58
00:03:08.001 --> 00:03:10.790

Winner!

64
00:03:29.121 --> 00:03:31.670
What? No way!
I want a rematch!

65
00:03:31.671 --> 00:03:33.880
We can't have
a bug-eating rematch.

66
00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:35.120
We ate all the bugs.

67
00:03:35.121 --> 00:03:38.580
Oh. Yeah. Maybe
something else then.

68
00:03:38.581 --> 00:03:41.120
You're on! Like what?

69
00:03:41.121 --> 00:03:42.670
Uh... I don't know.

70
00:03:42.671 --> 00:03:45.080
But I'll be back as soon as
I think of something.

71
00:03:45.081 --> 00:03:47.120
Okay, Bunga.
See you then.

72
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.960
If your so-called plan
had worked, we'd be
at the Tree of Life right now.

73
00:03:51.961 --> 00:03:54.880
As if your plan
was any better.

74
00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:58.710
Besides, it is
Makucha's fault
we are here.

75
00:03:58.711 --> 00:04:02.040
My fault? You should thank me
for getting us this far.

76
00:04:02.041 --> 00:04:04.170
(ALL GROWLING)

77
00:04:04.171 --> 00:04:06.830
Shush! All of ya!

78
00:04:06.831 --> 00:04:08.920
Mama's got a plan.

79
00:04:08.921 --> 00:04:13.170
And my plan
will actually work.

80
00:04:13.171 --> 00:04:16.040
What makes you so sure,
Mama Binturong?

81
00:04:16.041 --> 00:04:18.250
Because I am much smarter

82
00:04:18.251 --> 00:04:19.500
than you three.

83
00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:23.290
All I have to do is
trick the Night Pride

84
00:04:23.291 --> 00:04:26.000
into letting me
into the Tree of Life.

85
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.250
Once I'm in,

86
00:04:28.251 --> 00:04:31.040
I can find out
their weaknesses.

87
00:04:31.041 --> 00:04:33.120
Won't the Lion Guard
recognize you?

88
00:04:33.121 --> 00:04:37.540
The Lion Guard has never
seen me. Except for Bunga.

89
00:04:37.541 --> 00:04:40.420
And if he sees me,

90
00:04:40.421 --> 00:04:42.670
he'll wish he never had.

91
00:04:42.671 --> 00:04:46.500
That miserable honey badger

92
00:04:46.501 --> 00:04:49.210
destroyed my Tuliza.

93
00:04:49.211 --> 00:04:50.540
What's Tuliza?

94
00:04:50.541 --> 00:04:53.170
Never mind!
Now listen up.

95
00:04:53.171 --> 00:04:54.920
Here's the plan.

96
00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:59.670
MAMA BINTURONG: Help!

97
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Somebody help me, please!

98
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.750
Get her!
Please help me!

99
00:05:05.751 --> 00:05:08.080
(HOOTS) Better warn
the Night Pride.

100
00:05:08.081 --> 00:05:10.620

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.210
CHULUUN: (SNARLS)
Now we gotcha!

102
00:05:13.211 --> 00:05:16.000
No! No, please
get away from me.

103
00:05:16.001 --> 00:05:18.330
I'm just a little,
weak old lady!

104
00:05:18.331 --> 00:05:22.170
My favorite. (GROWLING)

105
00:05:22.171 --> 00:05:24.790
Ora. It's not
for real, remember?

106
00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:26.120
Oh, right.

107
00:05:26.121 --> 00:05:27.250
RANI: Stop right there!

108
00:05:27.251 --> 00:05:29.040
Leave that animal alone.

109
00:05:29.041 --> 00:05:30.250
Why should we?

110
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.880
Because I said so.

111
00:05:32.881 --> 00:05:35.120
Sounds like
fighting words to me.

112
00:05:35.121 --> 00:05:37.210
If that's what you want.

113
00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:38.960
With strength and respect...

114
00:05:38.961 --> 00:05:41.000
ALL: Night Pride Protect!

Okay, fine.

119
00:05:55.041 --> 00:05:57.120
You win this time,
Night Pride.

120
00:05:57.121 --> 00:05:59.330
And the next.
Count on it.

121
00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:01.580
Come on, guys.
Let's get out of here.

122
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.620
Oh, thank you so much

123
00:06:04.621 --> 00:06:07.920
for saving me
from those mean animals.

124
00:06:07.921 --> 00:06:09.000
No problem.

125
00:06:09.001 --> 00:06:12.580
You see, with my
injured leg and all,

126
00:06:12.581 --> 00:06:14.920
I could barely
outrun them.

127
00:06:14.921 --> 00:06:18.120
You're safe now,
and that's all that matters.

128
00:06:18.121 --> 00:06:20.000
Now let's get you
to the Tree of Life.

129
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.000
(QUIETLY) Perfect!

130
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.500
Oh, I'm so excited.
Come on, everyone!

131
00:06:25.501 --> 00:06:28.670
FULI: I can't wait.
KION: Yeah. It's what
we came here for.

132
00:06:28.671 --> 00:06:30.460
I just can't believe it.

133
00:06:30.461 --> 00:06:33.210
Me neither,
Little B. Finally.

134
00:06:33.211 --> 00:06:34.540
Ono's gonna get
his eyesight back.

135
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.580
No, I mean I just
can't believe that Binga
beat me at bug-eating.

136
00:06:38.581 --> 00:06:40.210
You lost.
Get over it.

137
00:06:40.211 --> 00:06:42.880
But I gotta come up
with another
honey badger challenge.

138
00:06:42.881 --> 00:06:44.750
Maybe you stink
more than she does.

139
00:06:44.751 --> 00:06:48.210
Yes! That's it! Stink contest.

140
00:06:48.211 --> 00:06:49.040
Thanks, Anga!

141
00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:50.920
Tell Ono I'll see him later.

142
00:06:50.921 --> 00:06:52.330
When he sees me!

143
00:06:52.331 --> 00:06:54.040
He's going now?

144
00:06:54.041 --> 00:06:55.790
NIRMALA: Hello, Lion Guard.

145
00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:57.330
Lion Guard?

146
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.540
It's okay.
They're our friends.

147
00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.290
(SOFTLY) No Bunga. Phew.

148
00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.380
KION: Rani. You here
for Ono's healing, too?

149
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.000
Actually, no.

150
00:07:09.001 --> 00:07:12.040
We have a new animal
to introduce to Queen Janna.

151
00:07:12.041 --> 00:07:13.170
Come on, everyone.

152
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:19.080
Welcome, traveler. I am Janna,
Queen of the Tree of Life.

153
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.540
What brings you here?

154
00:07:21.541 --> 00:07:23.120
We rescued her
from the villains

155
00:07:23.121 --> 00:07:25.000
lurking outside the pass.

156
00:07:25.001 --> 00:07:29.080
Why would they pick
on a weak, old lady
with a bad leg?

157
00:07:29.081 --> 00:07:31.830
You no longer need
to worry about them.

158
00:07:31.831 --> 00:07:34.080
You are safe
at the Tree of Life.

159
00:07:34.081 --> 00:07:36.830
We welcome all animals
who need healing.

160
00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:42.080
Perhaps we can even
help your leg.

161
00:07:42.081 --> 00:07:45.500
I believe you may be
our very first... Uh...

162
00:07:45.501 --> 00:07:48.000
Sorry, but what kind
of animal are you?

163
00:07:48.001 --> 00:07:51.460
Oh. Oh, yes.
I'm a... A ginterbong.

164
00:07:51.461 --> 00:07:54.170
I've never heard
of a ginterbong.

165
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:57.000
We're very, very rare.

166
00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.750
You can call
me Granny Ginterbong.

167
00:08:00.751 --> 00:08:05.420
Yes. And the Tree of Life
is home to many rare animals.

168
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.120
So I've heard!

169
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.250
Queen Janna,

170
00:08:09.251 --> 00:08:11.330
perhaps you can take me

171
00:08:11.331 --> 00:08:14.580
on a tour
of your beautiful land.

172
00:08:14.581 --> 00:08:16.210
Unfortunately,

173
00:08:16.211 --> 00:08:19.250
I no longer have the strength
to leave the Tree.

174
00:08:19.251 --> 00:08:21.580
But I'm sure
my granddaughter Rani

175
00:08:21.581 --> 00:08:24.080
would be happy
to show you around.

176
00:08:24.081 --> 00:08:27.540
Once she and the Night Pride
have rested from their patrol.

177
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.210
So the Night Pride
rests during the day?

178
00:08:31.211 --> 00:08:33.250
That makes perfect sense.

00:08:33.251 --> 00:08:37.420
I won't trouble you
for a tour right now, dearie.

180
00:08:37.421 --> 00:08:40.000
Maybe just show me to a tree

181
00:08:40.001 --> 00:08:41.710
where I can rest, too?

182
00:08:41.711 --> 00:08:44.580
Of course. Follow me,
Granny Ginterbong.

183
00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:47.210

a honey badger.

190
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:03.790
(YAWNS) Now,
about your tree?

191
00:09:03.791 --> 00:09:06.120
Oh, don't you
mind me, dear.

192
00:09:06.121 --> 00:09:09.210
I see there are lots
of trees here.

193
00:09:09.211 --> 00:09:12.000
You go rest
like your grandmother said.

194
00:09:12.001 --> 00:09:14.960
Uh, okay. Thank you.

is going to lead me
right to Bunga.

thought I'd say this,

but you're stinkier than me.

211
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:58.290
It's true. I'm stinkier,
and I eat bugs faster.

212
00:09:58.291 --> 00:10:00.710
Guess that means
I'm the better honey badger.

Not so fast!

00:10:02.211 --> 00:10:06.000

as strong as it once was.

That's strange.

Ono? You okay?

287
00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:52.080
Yes.
But Queen Janna was right.

My eyesight isn't
what it used to be.

Maybe you just need
to give it some time.

the Night Pride rests
during the day,

Me?

344
00:16:16.121 --> 00:16:19.380
You wouldn't happen
to have some Tuliza left

345
00:16:19.381 --> 00:16:21.670
for a hungry old lady?

346
00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:25.120
I don't have much left.
But you can have a little.

347
00:16:25.121 --> 00:16:28.170
I don't think
you understand.

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:31.290
So, Bunga.
Snowball fight?

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:35.670
Gotta go.
Another honey badger contest.

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.380
MAMA BINTURONG: I want it all!

353
00:16:43.381 --> 00:16:46.040
What's that? Hmm.

354
00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.210
Hey, Ono. Come on!

355
00:16:48.211 --> 00:16:49.830
There's still
lots more to see.

356
00:16:49.831 --> 00:16:51.580
Uh, right. Of course.

357
00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:54.080
CHULUUN:
What took you so long?

358
00:16:54.081 --> 00:16:56.880
I got distracted
looking for Bunga.

359
00:16:56.881 --> 00:16:58.880
But now I have a plan.

360
00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:02.210
The Queen of the Tree of Life
is old and weak.

361
00:17:02.211 --> 00:17:04.170
She can't even leave her lair.

362
00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:10.210
We take her out,
and everyone will panic.

363
00:17:10.211 --> 00:17:11.620
Then all those rare,

364
00:17:11.621 --> 00:17:14.000
delicious animals
will be ours.

365
00:17:14.001 --> 00:17:16.040
So what are we waiting for?

366
00:17:16.041 --> 00:17:18.000
You're gonna wait
for my plan.

367
00:17:18.001 --> 00:17:19.500
Now, listen.

368
00:17:19.501 --> 00:17:21.960
The Night Pride
only patrols at night.

369
00:17:21.961 --> 00:17:24.000
So at sunrise,
when they're all tired,

370
00:17:24.001 --> 00:17:27.460
I'll distract them
with a crisis
far away from the Tree.

371
00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:32.670
Then you three can go
to the Tree of Life,
and get rid of the Queen.

372
00:17:32.671 --> 00:17:34.040
What about the Lion Guard?

373
00:17:34.041 --> 00:17:35.750
They're short-handed.

374
00:17:35.751 --> 00:17:38.920
Kion and Bunga
aren't even with them.

375
00:17:38.921 --> 00:17:41.000
They'll be easy
to take care of.

376
00:17:41.001 --> 00:17:44.670
Just leave that Bunga to me!

377
00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:50.710
MAMA BINTURONG:
Oh, no! Help!

378
00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:54.080
That sounds like
Granny Ginterbong.

379
00:17:54.081 --> 00:17:56.580
RANI: Ullu, can you tell
where she is?

380
00:17:56.581 --> 00:17:58.620
MAMA BINTURONG:
Help me! Help me!

381
00:17:58.621 --> 00:18:01.250
(HOOTS) Sounds like
it's coming from Ciso River.

382
00:18:01.251 --> 00:18:03.420
That's way on the other side
of the Tree of Life.

383
00:18:03.421 --> 00:18:05.380
How did the bad guys
get past us?

384
00:18:05.381 --> 00:18:07.620
I don't know.
But we need to
stop them.

385
00:18:07.621 --> 00:18:09.210
Ullu. Find the Lion Guard.

386
00:18:09.211 --> 00:18:10.460
Ask them to meet us
at the river.

387
00:18:10.461 --> 00:18:13.170
That's what I'll do! (HOOTING)

388
00:18:13.171 --> 00:18:15.210
With strength and respect...

389
00:18:15.211 --> 00:18:17.330
ALL: Night Pride protect!

390
00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:19.420
Ha!

391
00:18:19.421 --> 00:18:22.120
The Night Pride
fell for it.
Let's go!

392
00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:28.170
ULLU: Kion. Lion Guard.
Wake up! (HOOTING)

393
00:18:28.171 --> 00:18:29.290
Rani needs your help.

394
00:18:29.291 --> 00:18:30.380
What?

395
00:18:30.381 --> 00:18:32.330
Ullu? What's going on?

396
00:18:32.331 --> 00:18:35.830
It's Granny Ginterbong.
She's being attacked
near the icy river.

397
00:18:35.831 --> 00:18:36.920
Oh, no!

398
00:18:36.921 --> 00:18:37.960
Anga?
On it.

399
00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:43.960
Help! Chuluun is attacking me!

400
00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.880
She's hanging from a branch.
But I don't see any bad guys.

401
00:18:48.881 --> 00:18:50.120
If there's snow,

402
00:18:50.121 --> 00:18:51.540
Chuluun could be hiding in it.

403
00:18:51.541 --> 00:18:53.080
Right. Let's go.

404
00:18:53.081 --> 00:18:55.080
(HOOTING) Follow me!

405
00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.500
Wait a tick. How does
Granny Ginterbong know
Chuluun's name?

406
00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:03.210
<i>Nawaza, nawaza, nawaza...
Hapana!</i>

407
00:19:03.211 --> 00:19:07.330
Everyone. Everyone!
Stop! This is a trick!

408
00:19:07.331 --> 00:19:09.120
Ono? What do you mean?

409
00:19:09.121 --> 00:19:11.750
Granny Ginterbong isn't
who she says she is.

410
00:19:11.751 --> 00:19:12.830
Listen.

411
00:19:12.831 --> 00:19:14.460
I've never heard
of a ginterbong.

412
00:19:14.461 --> 00:19:17.500
I've seen her climbing
and walking without a limp.

413
00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.620
<i>She scared off a pika
and stole his Tuliza.</i>

414
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.420
Chuluun is attacking me!

415
00:19:23.421 --> 00:19:25.750
ONO: <i>And she knows
Chuluun's name!</i>

416
00:19:25.751 --> 00:19:28.120
I think she must be
working with Chuluun.

417
00:19:28.121 --> 00:19:29.920
And Makucha and Ora.

418
00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:33.380
ANGA: Ono's right!

419
00:19:33.381 --> 00:19:35.080
They're headed
for the Tree of Life.

420
00:19:35.081 --> 00:19:37.960
Smart. Great insight, Ono.

421
00:19:37.961 --> 00:19:39.750
Ullu! Go tell Rani.

422
00:19:39.751 --> 00:19:42.040
Granny Ginterbong
is just a decoy.

423
00:19:42.041 --> 00:19:44.000
(HOOTING) Will do!

424
00:19:44.001 --> 00:19:46.000
Lion Guard, with me!

425
00:19:46.001 --> 00:19:48.380
I have never
met a Queen.

426
00:19:48.381 --> 00:19:50.880
Then you better
say hello fast.

427
00:19:50.881 --> 00:19:53.580
And then say goodbye.
(LAUGHS)

428
00:19:53.581 --> 00:19:55.210
KION: Stop right there,
Makucha!

429
00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:59.000
You really thought
you could fool us?

430
00:19:59.001 --> 00:20:02.080
Not us.
It was the old lady's idea.

431
00:20:02.081 --> 00:20:04.040
Well, here's my idea.

432
00:20:04.041 --> 00:20:05.290
Get out!

433
00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.540

436
00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.620
Forget it.
The plan's ruined.

437
00:20:15.621 --> 00:20:16.670
Let's get outta here.

438
00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.170
Wait for us.
Yeah!

439
00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.170
What's taking them so long?

440
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:26.080
Old lady in trouble here.

442
00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.460
Bunga!

443
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000
So, we meet again,
Mr. Bunga.

444
00:20:35.001 --> 00:20:36.670
Mama Binturong?

445
00:20:36.671 --> 00:20:39.670
You destroyed my Tuliza.

446
00:20:39.671 --> 00:20:42.380
But now I'm gonna get you

447
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:45.330
and your little friend, too.

Bunga!
You're Bing-credible!

453
00:20:55.751 --> 00:20:57.330
I thought I was
un-Bunga-lievable.

454
00:20:57.331 --> 00:20:58.830
RANI: Night Pride!
Over here!

455
00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:02.790
Night Pride! Oh!

456
00:21:02.791 --> 00:21:06.500
Those honey badgers!
They attacked me!

457
00:21:06.501 --> 00:21:08.670
Say what?
She attacked us!

458
00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:13.790
Curious.
She's no longer limping.

459
00:21:13.791 --> 00:21:16.290
(HOOTING)
Rani. Night Pride.

460
00:21:16.291 --> 00:21:18.500
That ginterbong isn't
who she says she is!

461
00:21:18.501 --> 00:21:22.000
She's not a ginterbong.
She's a binturong!

462
00:21:22.001 --> 00:21:23.380
Common knowledge,
really.

463
00:21:23.381 --> 00:21:27.250
Night Pride, we need
to make sure she leaves
the Tree of Life.

We've got something
I know will get rid of her!

Come on, Binga!

466
00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.170
Curious. I wonder
what that is.

467
00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:37.000
I think I know.

Yes. My vision
may not be what it was,

474
00:21:55.831 --> 00:21:58.170
You definitely helped.
Thank you.

475
00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:00.330
Rani's right, Ono.

476
00:22:00.331 --> 00:22:02.750
Even if you're not
the keenest of sight,

477
00:22:02.751 --> 00:22:04.960
you are the keenest
of insight.
