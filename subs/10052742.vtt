I can take that
trail upriver.

Don't worry, Ono.
I'll be fine.

much of a choice.

cross the river here.

where that is.

I was up here.
Did ya?

No, I...

114
00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:02.959
I knew you were
there the whole time.

115
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.040
Hyena.

116
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.920
Yep, I'm a hyena
all right.

are so clever!

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.420
You know me?
Just by reputation.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.540

on your shoulder's
a giveaway, though.

Janja? Yeah,
that's a good one.

126
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.880
What are you doing
in the Outlands?

127
00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.080
Not exactly
your territory.

128
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.170
I'm going to
Flat Ridge Rock,

129
00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.670
so I can get back
to the Pride Lands.

130
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.249
If that's okay with you,

131
00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:37.459
hyena.

132
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.080
The name's Jasiri.

133
00:06:39.121 --> 00:06:42.871
And if you are headed
back to the Pride Lands,
you're going the wrong way.

134
00:06:42.871 --> 00:06:46.750
Uh-huh. And I should
trust a hyena because...

135
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.919
Because I want you
out of my territory.

136
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:54.040
Good. I want out
of your territory.
(SCOFFS)

137
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.210
Then you're going
the wrong way!

138
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.670
Thanks for getting us
outta the woods, Ono.

139
00:07:04.711 --> 00:07:07.921
No problem. But I don't know
which way to go from here.

140
00:07:07.921 --> 00:07:09.580
I've never been
to Flat Ridge Rock.

141
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.619
Neither have I.
Me neither.

142
00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.250
Well, it's probably
around here somewhere.

trees and zebras.

we don't know
where to go!

145
00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.039
We're the Lion Guard!

146
00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:27.499
(SIGHS) This never happens
when Kion's around!

147
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.960
Easy, Fuli.

148
00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.420
We just need to ask
somebody for directions.

149
00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:35.420
Hello, Lion Guard.
I couldn't help
but overhear.

150
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.539
You need directions?

151
00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:38.620
Yeah, we do!

152
00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.040
Do you know where
Flat Ridge Rock is?

153
00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.750
Flat Ridge Rock?

154
00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:46.040
Oh! Is that
near Ukuni Woods?

155
00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.879
Or Big Springs?

156
00:07:47.879 --> 00:07:49.959
We don't know
where it is.

157
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.920
That's why
we're asking you!

158
00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.000
I see. Well,
that's too bad.

159
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.120
I'm not sure where it is.

160
00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.290
Now, where was I going?

161
00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:01.829
Uh, maybe back
to your herd?

162
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:04.670
Oh yes, of course!

163
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.500
Thank you!

164
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.170
Zebras. (SIGHS)

165
00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:10.380
They never know
where they're going.

166
00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.879
Hey! We could ask
Mbeya the Rhino!

167
00:08:12.879 --> 00:08:15.619
He knows
the Pride Lands like
the back of his horn.

168
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.290
Great. Any idea where
we can find Mbeya?

169
00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:21.831
This time of day,
Mbeya usually hangs out
at the watering hole.

170
00:08:21.831 --> 00:08:25.919
Yeah! Watering hole,
here we come.

171
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.960

Ono, you lead
this time.

172

Affirmative!
Follow me!

FULI: This way, Bunga.

174
00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:39.329

a shortcut.

176
00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.210
Still following me?

177
00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.250
You're still
ignoring my advice.

178
00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:56.620
About going the wrong way?
(SCOFFS)

179
00:08:56.661 --> 00:08:59.211
I'm pretty sure
I'm heading towards
Flat Ridge Rock.

180
00:08:59.211 --> 00:09:02.379
Maybe so,
but you can't get
there on this trail.

181
00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.540
Oh, yeah?
Why's that?

182
00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.210
The trail ends.
Here!

183
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:07.380
What? Whoa...

187
00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:21.040
(SIGHS) How long
can it possibly take

188
00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:24.040
to ask for directions
to Flat Ridge Rock?

189
00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.749
They've been
talking forever!

190
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:27.920
Beshte does
like to talk.

191
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.040
Yes. But perhaps
I'd better go talk to him.

192
00:09:31.081 --> 00:09:34.331
You get to be my age,
you never know
what might happen!

193

194
00:09:35.789 --> 00:09:37.749
Sorry to interrupt.
But Beshte?

195
00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:38.920
We have to meet Kion?

196
00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.250
At Flat Ridge Rock?

197
00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:42.460
Oh yeah! Guess
I better be going.

198
00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:45.620
See you later, Mbeya.
Later, Beshte.

199
00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.539
So?
What did he say?

200
00:09:47.539 --> 00:09:48.919
You won't believe it.

201
00:09:48.919 --> 00:09:51.209
Remember that heatwave
we had yesterday?

202
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:52.920
Yeah, I remember.
It was hot.

203
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.580
Now what did Mbeya say?

204
00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.880
He forgot to cover
himself in mud!

205
00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.750
(LAUGHS)

206
00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:01.169
Why would Mbeya
want to cover himself
in mud, Big B?

207
00:10:01.169 --> 00:10:02.619
That's how
rhinos avoid sunburn.

208
00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:04.330
Common knowledge, really.

209
00:10:04.371 --> 00:10:09.041
(SIGHS) I meant,
what did Mbeya say
about the directions?

210
00:10:09.041 --> 00:10:12.791
(CHUCKLES) Fuli, you don't
need directions to cover
yourself in mud.

211
00:10:12.791 --> 00:10:15.039
Just find a nice
mud puddle and roll in it.

212
00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.460
Argh! Not directions
for mud bathing.

213
00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:21.460
Directions for getting
to Flat Ridge Rock!

214
00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:24.380
Oh, yeah!
The directions to
Flat Ridge Rock!

215
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.290

Be right back.

217
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:33.790

forget something like that.

Hey, what are you doing?

222
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.290
Getting you out
of this thorn bush.

223
00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.920
If you'd just hold still!

224
00:10:47.789 --> 00:10:50.289
What? Why would
you help me?

225
00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:51.960
You're a hyena.

226
00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.830
You lions really do think
all hyenas are bad!

227
00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:56.620
All the ones I've met are.

228
00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:58.790
Like Janja, Cheezi,
and Chungu?

229
00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:02.919
(CHUCKLES)
Well, obviously,
I'm not like them.

230
00:11:02.961 --> 00:11:06.751
For one thing, they're males.
Which means they're foolish.

231
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.830
No offense.

232
00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:11.170
Not all males are foolish.

233
00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:14.460
Says the male lion
flat on his back,
stuck in a bush.

(LAUGHING)

235
00:11:18.501 --> 00:11:21.751
Things would certainly
go a lot better if Kion
were leading us.

236
00:11:21.751 --> 00:11:24.620
Yeah. But you gotta
love all these flies!

237
00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.790
Ugh. Yeah,
gotta love 'em.

238
00:11:29.831 --> 00:11:34.751
Beshte, are you positive
Mbeya said this is the way
to Flat Ridge Rock?

239
00:11:34.751 --> 00:11:37.920
Yep! 'Course, he also said
he's never actually
been there.

241

Everyone! There's
a ridge up ahead with
a flat rock on top of it!

242
00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:48.379

This time,
I'll lead the way.

247
00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:03.000
Fuli, slow down!
How can you lead us
when we can't keep up?

248
00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.460
Thanks...
I guess.

249
00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:09.790
You guess?

250
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:11.500
Well, yeah!

251
00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:14.580
You could have told me
the trail ended before
I went over the hill!

252
00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:16.040
Yeah. But then
I wouldn't have seen

253
00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:18.880
the leader of the Lion Guard
rolling down a hill!

Okay, you've had your laugh.
Now I'm lost.

256
00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:27.829
Can you tell me how
to get to Flat Ridge Rock?

257
00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:29.080
Follow that trail.

258
00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.920
It'll take you
to Flat Ridge Rock.

259
00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.250
And back to
your beloved Pride Lands.

You're limping.
I'm fine.

262
00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:40.710
Just a little sore
from the fall.

263
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:42.000
I can handle it.

264
00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:44.710
Okay, tell ya what.

265
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:47.460
It's kinda
my fault you're hurt.

266
00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:51.290
So I'll stick with you
until you can see
Flat Ridge Rock.

267
00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:54.670
Okay. I mean,
if you want to.

268
00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:56.670
What I want?
(LAUGHS)

269
00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:59.040

of my territory!

Fuli?

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.289
Hi, guys.
What kept you?

274
00:13:12.289 --> 00:13:15.039
I even had time
to clean up.

275
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.000
Uh, Fuli?

276
00:13:17.041 --> 00:13:21.161
Usually Kion wouldn't get
so far ahead that the rest
of us have trouble keeping up.

277
00:13:21.161 --> 00:13:23.000
Oh. Sorry, guys.

278
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.669
Wait! This is
Flat Ridge Rock?

279
00:13:25.669 --> 00:13:27.499
Well, this rock
is pretty flat.

280
00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.210
And it's on a ridge.

281
00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:31.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!

282
00:13:31.041 --> 00:13:34.461
I know this place!
I've been here
hundreds of times!

283
00:13:34.461 --> 00:13:37.830
You know,
there's a great shortcut
we could have used!

See that? That's
the Circle of Life for you.

288
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.540
Wait. You think I don't know
about the Circle of Life?

289
00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.500
Well, you are a hyena.

290
00:13:54.541 --> 00:13:58.921
Look. I know Janja's clan
is greedy and eats more
than their share.

291
00:13:58.921 --> 00:14:01.999
But most hyenas
respect the Circle of Life!

292
00:14:01.999 --> 00:14:03.579
We're the clean-up crews.

293
00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:06.250
Picking up after
all the sloppy eaters.

294
00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:09.540
We hyenas eat what
you lions leave behind.

295
00:14:09.581 --> 00:14:13.541
Oh. I guess I never really
thought about it like that.

296
00:14:13.541 --> 00:14:16.669
(LAUGHS)
Of course not.

297
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:20.540
You think hyenas
and lions are so different.

to move you myself?
