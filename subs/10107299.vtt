Move it!

Before the Lion Guard
shows up.

7
00:01:10.879 --> 00:01:12.379
Right! Move it, melon!

8
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.960
Janja! This melon's
got water inside it.

9
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.750
They all do, fur-brain.

10
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.290
That's why we're takin' 'em.

11
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.379

I'm thirsty.

16
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.169
Those melons are
for the elephants!

17
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.420
Oh, are they?
Well, don't worry, Kion.
We'll bring 'em right back.

18
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.330
After we drink
all their water.

19
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.750
Move it, fellas!

20
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.380
We gotta stop them!

21
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.379
Come on!

22
00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:49.749

Hey! (GRUNTS)

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:59.499
That's one!

27
00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:01.209
Give back that
melon, Chungu!

28
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.330
Uh-uh.

29
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.170
I stole it fair and square!

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.330

Somebody grab
that last melon!

37
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.500
I got it! I got it!
(GRUNTS)

38
00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:25.079
I don't got it.

39
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.380
BESHTE: Good try, Little B.

40
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.210
At least we saved
the other ones.

41
00:02:29.251 --> 00:02:32.081
How'd the hyenas even find
the elephants' melon patch?

42
00:02:32.081 --> 00:02:33.670
(SCOFFS) Luck,
I'm guessing.

43
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.379
Gotta be. The patch
is really well hidden.

44
00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:38.959
Indeed. It's even difficult
for me to see!

45
00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:42.421
We'll have to keep
a close eye on them,
in case the hyenas come back.

46
00:02:42.421 --> 00:02:44.170
We gotta guard fruit?

47
00:02:44.211 --> 00:02:46.871
The melons help
give the elephants
the water they need

48
00:02:46.871 --> 00:02:48.379
to make it through
the dry season.

49
00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:49.919
Common knowledge, really.

50
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.960
It's all part of
the Circle of Life.

51
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.880
And defending it is our job.

JANJA: (SIGHS)
Another one of
my brilliant plans,

53
00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.749
ruined by the Lion Guard!

54
00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:02.749
Yeah. Those guys are always
gettin' in our way.

55
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.620

(ROARING)

61
00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.790
Hi, Scar.

62
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.790
What happened this time?

63
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.420
We stumbled onto
some Tikiti melons
and was gonna take 'em.

64
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.119
But then the Lion Guard
stumbled onto us, and, uh...

65
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.080
Tikiti melons!

66
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.290
Ah, yes.

67
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.379
Did you know
they got water
inside 'em?

68
00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:38.249
Yes. Precious water.

69
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.750
The Pride Lands' elephants
would be vulnerable

70
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.580
without those melons.

71
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.500
Especially during
the dry season.

72
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.419
Hyenas!
(ALL WHIMPER)

73
00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:51.119
Go back and take all
of the Tikiti melons.

74
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.420
If the elephants don't
have enough water,

75
00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.420
it will mean the
end of their herd!

76
00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.920
And perhaps
the Circle of Life, as well!

77
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.419
(CHUCKLES MENACINGLY)

78
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.750
Uh, Scar?
We totally wanna help.

79
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.880
But the Lion Guard's
just gonna stop us again.

80
00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.960
I know a lizard who can
stop the Lion Guard.

81
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.539
Then you'll have plenty
of time to steal the melons.

82
00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.500
A lizard? You mean,
like one of those skinks?

little lizard gonna
stop the Lion Guard?

Trust me, my friend
is not a little lizard.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.420
I'm going to let them find me!

Kion, how much longer are
we gonna stick around here?

the hyenas'll come back

Not too smart,
if you ask me.

Yeah, yeah, I know.

146
00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.420

losing these melons.

Actually, I'm thrilled.

178
00:08:48.789 --> 00:08:50.209
Bring it on.

179
00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:51.790
You asked for it.

180
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:52.620
(SNARLS)

181
00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:53.620
Whoa!

182
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:56.380
(GRUNTS)

183
00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:57.580
(GROWLS)

184
00:08:59.289 --> 00:09:00.379
Oh!

185
00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.120
Ow!

186
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.710
My legs!
What's going on?

187
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:08.250
Kion!
What's wrong?

188
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:10.420
I don't feel so good!

189
00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:11.959
(GRUNTS)

190
00:09:11.959 --> 00:09:14.499
Ushari was right
about Kenge.

191
00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:15.750
He's takin' 'em down!

192
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:17.120
Yeah! (CACKLES)

193
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.880
Down and out!

194
00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.670
Come on, I dare you!

195
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:23.830
(LAUGHS) Listen
to the honey badger!

196
00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.499
He thinks he's brave enough
to fight Kenge!

197
00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.960
Biggest lizard
in the Outlands!

198
00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.420
I don't just think it!
I know it!

199
00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:34.830
Really? I smell fear.

200
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:37.579
I'll give you
something to smell!

201
00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.040
(BUNGA FARTS)

202
00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.960
(COUGHING)

203
00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.790
Yeah, that's right,
you lizard!

204
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.040
Run!
(GAGGING)

205
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.880
CHUNGU: Hey, wait for us!

206
00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.499
(SNIFFS DEEPLY)

207
00:09:47.999 --> 00:09:50.289
Smells like victory.

208
00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:52.080
Are you guys okay?

209
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.460
Yeah, but...

210
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:56.750
(GRUNTS)
My legs won't move!

211
00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:58.790
(GRUNTS) Neither will mine!

212
00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:00.499
I can't even feel them.

213
00:10:00.499 --> 00:10:02.079
They're just numb.

214
00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.620
Of course. Kenge must
be a monitor lizard!

215
00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.290
I've never seen one
until now!

216
00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:09.620
What does that have to do
with our legs being numb?

217
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:13.210
A monitor lizard's bite
contains venom
which causes paralysis.

218
00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:14.709
Common knowledge, really.

219
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:16.670
So that's why
our legs won't move?

220
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:17.960
Yes, but don't worry.

221
00:10:18.001 --> 00:10:20.791
The venom will wear off
and your legs will go
back to normal.

222
00:10:20.791 --> 00:10:21.960
Great! When?

223
00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.039
(GASPS) I have no idea.

224
00:10:25.039 --> 00:10:27.579
Well, we can't
just sit here!

225
00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:29.750
That lizard is roaming
the Pride Lands!

226
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:31.420
He could bite someone else!

227
00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.460
Ono, get Rafiki.

228
00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.460
Maybe he has a remedy that
can heal our legs faster.

229
00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.329
Affirmative!

230
00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:40.920
Don't worry.
I'll stay here
and protect you

231
00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.750
in case that lizard
comes back.

232
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:44.120
Ugh!

233
00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:47.750
Rafiki? Rafiki!

234
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:50.959
Oh, please be home,
please be home. Rafiki?

235
00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:54.830
Oh, hi, Ono!
Rafiki's gone for the day.

236
00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:56.080
I'm watching his tree.

237
00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.040
Well, I'm not really
watching it, I'm more like...

238
00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.499
A monitor lizard bit
Kion, Fuli and Beshte!

239
00:11:01.499 --> 00:11:03.169
Their legs won't move!

240
00:11:03.211 --> 00:11:07.211
Oh, no! If they can't move,
then they can't protect
the Pride Lands.

241
00:11:07.211 --> 00:11:08.790
And if they can't protect
the Pride Lands,

242
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:10.880
then the Pride Lands
are unprotected, and...

243
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.379
The venom will wear off.

244
00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:15.710
We were hoping
Rafiki had a remedy
to help them heal faster.

245
00:11:15.711 --> 00:11:19.371
Oh, I'm sure he does!
Oh, but he's not here.
Oh, but I'm here.

246
00:11:19.371 --> 00:11:23.121
And Rafiki's teaching me
all about remedies.
So maybe I can help!

247
00:11:23.121 --> 00:11:25.919
But, we were...
Or, I mean, I can try to help.

248
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.880
I've never actually
made a remedy before.

249
00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.170
I've watched him
do it, though.

250
00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:31.000
Thanks, Makini.

251
00:11:31.041 --> 00:11:34.211
The Lion Guard has
to stop that lizard before
he bites someone else!

252
00:11:34.211 --> 00:11:35.829
Who's the fastest now, Fuli?

253
00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:37.919
Huh? Huh?
Who's the fastest now?

254
00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.000
Still me.

255
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.920
Yeah, okay.
But I'm still
the bravest!

256
00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.420
ONO: Everyone! Everyone!

257
00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.620
Rafiki's gone all day...

258
00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:47.919
But I'm here!

259
00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.750
And I'm going to find a way
to help your legs heal faster!

260
00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:52.790
Or, I'm gonna try.

261
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:53.880
Thanks, Makini!

262
00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.920
Yeah! We've gotta
get back on our feet

263
00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.290
and catch that lizard!

264
00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:59.040
We really need your help.

265
00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.539
But no pressure.

266
00:12:00.539 --> 00:12:02.079
Okay, now, let's see.

267
00:12:02.121 --> 00:12:05.121
I remember Rafiki telling me
something that can help heal.

268
00:12:05.121 --> 00:12:08.960
I think it was Ghanda root!
Or the kioo stone.

269
00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.380
Or maybe kupona sap?

270
00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:12.669
She's still learning.

271
00:12:12.669 --> 00:12:16.789
(GASPS) Oh, oh, I know!
Ponya flowers!

272
00:12:16.831 --> 00:12:20.371
I'm almost totally sure
that's what Rafiki said
can help!

273
00:12:20.371 --> 00:12:22.000
Okay!
Great!

274
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.879
Oh. But I don't have
any Ponya flowers. Do you?

275
00:12:25.879 --> 00:12:27.539
Uh, no.

276
00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.170
I can find
the flowers, Makini.

277
00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:30.790
I am the keenest of sight.

278
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:32.960
Oh, thank you, Ono!
That would be great.

279
00:12:33.001 --> 00:12:36.251
Especially because
I don't know what
Ponya flowers look like!

280
00:12:36.251 --> 00:12:37.829
Well, they're bright red...

281
00:12:37.829 --> 00:12:38.919
Hmm.

282
00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:42.960
And there's a big bush
of them by Big Springs!

283
00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.790
(HYENAS CACKLING)
Wait a tick.

284
00:12:46.329 --> 00:12:47.999
(GASPS) Hapana!

285
00:12:47.999 --> 00:12:50.119
Everyone! Janja,
Cheezi and Chungu

286
00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.040
are heading back
to the melon patch.

287
00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.580
And Kenge's with them!

288
00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.290
Heyvi kabisa!

289
00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:58.000
The hyenas
and the monitor lizard?

290
00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.330
They must be working together!

291
00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:00.539
But why?

292
00:13:00.539 --> 00:13:03.079
Janja must have
asked Kenge to bite us

293
00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.920
so we couldn't stop them
from taking the melons!

294
00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.170
Wait till I get my legs back.

295
00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:09.250
And you will!

296
00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:11.540
As soon as I get
the Ponya flowers!

297
00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:15.379
Bunga. Ono. You've gotta
stop Kenge and the hyenas.

298
00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:16.920
No problem, Kion.

299
00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:19.540
They'll be sorry they
ever left the Outlands.

300
00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:22.000

But, you mean, just us?

Sure! We've got
brains and bravery!

302
00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:25.619
What more do we need?

303
00:13:25.619 --> 00:13:27.999
Hmm. I guess
there's no other choice.

304
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.080

BUNGA: Lion Guard defend!

306
00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.960
Remember, this time
we gotta take all the melons.

307
00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.539
Then the elephants
won't have nothin' to drink

308
00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:42.120
when their
watering holes go dry.

Hey, lizard!

311
00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.460
You wanna give us
a little help here or what?

312
00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:48.539
Little?

in charge here?

317
00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:01.789
But, uh, maybe not.

318
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:05.500
Janja! You say
that all the time!

319
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:06.670
Yeah!

I'm in charge!"

321
00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.580
Maybe you're
in charge of them.

322
00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:14.459
But you're not
in charge of me!

323

324
00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:18.960
Now we start rolling!

325
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.000
Yeah, yeah.

326
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.460
Okay!
Sure!

327
00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:24.080
My venom won't stall
the Lion Guard forever.

328
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.920
We'll need to get
to the Outlands before
they recover!

329
00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:29.460
Too late for that, lizard.

330
00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:32.540
The Lion Guard's already
here to stop you!

331
00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.120
What Lion Guard?

332
00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.460
Most of you
ain't even here,
thanks to Kenge.

333
00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:40.169
Uh, the very big Kenge!

334
00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:41.670
That's right.

335
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:44.210
You two can't
possibly stop us.

336
00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:46.580
Oh, yeah?
We'll see about that!

00:14:49.119 --> 00:14:51.039
Hyenas! You take the melons.

I deal with these two!

340
00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.080
Whatever you say, Kenge!

341
00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.000
You take the hyenas, Ono.

342
00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.210
I've got the lizard.

00:14:58.210 --> 00:14:59.960
